Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE),https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/iYAuzHYbTBO23jzjC1lSug,Cardiac,Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE),Learn how to obtain TAPSE using the Butterfly,Michael Stone,5/10/2023,"We are going to show you how to calculate the TAP-C or Tricuspid Annual Plane of Cystolic Excursion. The first thing that we're going to want to do is make sure that we're on the appropriate preset by hitting that preset button and selecting Cardiac and next Holly is going to show us how to obtain an apical 4-chamber view. After we get that apical 4-chamber view we can optimize our image just a tad bit by maneuvering the transducer changing the gain a bit because you want to see that lateral wall of that right ventricle and once you get a good view we're going to now put the emo tracing on it so hit the actions button and then hit the emo button and bring that emo cursor over to the lateral wall of that right ventricle. Now what we're seeing here is we're seeing just like two to three beats we want to see more of it so what you can do to change the sweep speed is just hit that fast button and now we've changed the sweep speed so we can see a lot more of that emo tracing. After we get a good emo tracing Holly is going to hit the freeze button and then calculate the excursion. The way that you do that is you select the measure button, hit the line tool and then select and it peek to a trough. So let's start off by placing it at the trough and then the second part of the line we're going to put it on the peak right there so we have a trough to peak and what's good about the butterfly app is that you just have to measure the slope and it will calculate the wide distance of that triangle for you and we see here a number of 2.04 for this patient's tapsee and that's how you use the butterfly to evaluate the patient's tapsee."
Central Venous Access - Subclavian Vein,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/XCVroOpEQVu0PnQEhG-3Zw,Vascular Access,Central Venous Access - Subclavian Vein,Learning scanning techniques for placing a subclavian vein central line.,Adwana Clayton,3/22/2023,"I'm going to show you how to evaluate the subclavian vein for central venous catheterization. You want to make sure that you're in the appropriate preset. We have the vascular access preset selected here, which is the right one. And then you're going to want to place the probe on the patient. Go ahead and use a pencil grip on that transducer and identify the midpoint of the clavicle. Place your transducer with the probe marker towards the patient's head. Place it right there. And we see the first landmark right here. So this is a hyperacolic arc with some shadowing deep to it. That is the clavicle. We are going to bring the transducer just a little more inferiorly. Now we're going to track it in the lateral aspect to identify the blood vessels. We're slowly coming out. And then we're starting to see a structure just on the deep field right here. We're a little off screen, so we're going to adjust the depth to four centimeters. And we're going to increase our gain to be able to see a little bit better. And then we're going to continue tracking out laterally. And we can see here that we see a hypocoic circle. And then we are seeing a second one just deep to it. One of those is the vein. One of those is the artery. The first one that pops out is going to be your vein. And the second one is going to be the artery. And if you're not sure, there's a couple of things that you can do to confirm. If you're able to, you can push down just a little bit. And you can see that one collapses while the other one doesn't. The other thing that you can do is you can actually put color doppler on those blood vessels to see which one has pulsed the tile flow and which one has more venous flow. We can see here that we're seeing venous flow on that first blood vessel there, which is confirming that we have a venous structure, not an arterial structure. Once we've identified the vessel that we want to cannulate, we have to be considered about where our venous puncture is actually going to happen. When we are doing subclavian lines in forclavian lines with our landmark guidance, we typically do is we aim for our puncture site to be just underneath that clavicle aiming for that super journal notch. It's a little different with ultrasound guidance because we want to make sure that we are approaching that vein in parallel with the path of that vein. We're not getting at it obliquely. So to do that, once we've identified the vein, which we're seeing right here, we actually track it more inferiorly and laterally to make sure that it's saying in the center of the screen as we move that transducer back and forth. This confirms that at this plane where I have the transducer, I am perpendicular to the path of that vein. And when I do that, I know that if I come with my needle perpendicular to the probe, I am parallel to the vein. So our puncture site is actually going to be a little more inferior and a little more lateral than we typically do with landmark guidance. Now that is in the short axis. If we want to do the long axis, once we have centered our vein there on the screen, we're going to slowly rotate our transducer probe marker up towards the patient's head to get that vein in the long axis. You can see here that vein in the long axis. Now what's good about doing it in the long axis, about doing your cannulation that way, is that you can actually create a safety backstop for your procedure. If we look deep to the vein here, we're actually seeing a rib with shadowing. And if we are approaching our cannulation from this location here, our needle will come in here. And if we happen to go a little bit too far and accidentally puncture that posterior wall, we're just going to hit this rib. We're not going to hit the other scary structure that's deep to it, which we can actually see as I go a little more inferiorly right here, which is the long pleura. It's actually very close. When we approach it this way with that rib right underneath, we are much safer when we do these cannulations. Of note, when we do the initial venopuncture, we're actually doing our venopuncture in the axillary vein as it turns into the subclavian. And we want to make sure to do our puncture of that vein before it goes underneath that clavicle. Because if we happen to not have cannulated that vein and the needle tips underneath the clavicle, we can't see it because the ultrasound cannot see deep to bone. Now that is the infra-clavicular approach. We can also do a supraclavicular approach. We're just going to move your head over that way. And then what we do is we'll first identify the jugular vein, which we can see right here in the center of the screen. And we're going to track that down to see when it becomes the brachiosophallic, which is what we're seeing right there. And if we track it a little more lateral, we can now see a hypoechoic linear structure. We're going to actually see a valve right there. And that is where we would do our cannulation for the subclavian vein in the supraclavicular location. We do our venopuncture right there. And that is how you use your butterfly to evaluate the subclavian vein for central venous access. [no audio]"
Femoral Artery Line Placement,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/sjL4op5ORb-kJAXgFP8ekQ,Procedural,Femoral Artery Line Placement,Learn scanning techniques for placing a femoral arterial line,Adwana Clayton,3/22/2023,"This is how you evaluate a patient for adequate femoral artery line placement. First things first, what we're going to do is make sure that we have the appropriate preset. We want to be in the vascular access preset. I'm going to put the transducer down for a little bit, get a little ultrasound gel on there. Now, if the patient is able to have them externally rotate the leg that you are going to be evaluating, but if not, obviously go ahead and do that for them. You want that transducer marker right here. You want that to go towards the patient's right. And we're going to aim for about the middle part of the upper thigh just on the coddle end of that in-line ligament, right about here. So I see a bunch of soft tissue up here. There's a muscle over here. I'm going to slide a little more laterally. And there I'm seeing some circles that have hypoec fluid on the inside of them. These are the femoral blood vessels. Now, if you're not sure which one is which, what you can do is actually hold down pressure. And as we hold down pressure, we see that some of the blood vessels, they will completely collapse. The other ones collapse less and they begin to pulsate. The pulsatile ones are going to be the arteries. The non-pulsatile ones are going to be the veins. Now, I'm going to optimize my image just a little bit. I'm going to increase that gain so I can see it a little bit more clearly. I'm going to give it one more little bit on that depth right there. And what I'm going to do now is find exactly where to cannulate on that artery. So let's focus on that artery right there in the middle. Now, I'm going to go up the leg towards the in-line ligament. And you see how right there the two branches of the artery, they will combine right there. Now, I'm going to move distally. You can see them separate. I'm going to hold down pressure. And you can see that they both are pulsatile. Those are branches of that femoral artery. Right here, we have the common femoral. And then over here, we have the branch point to the deep and the superficial branches. When you are cannulating the femoral artery, always make sure to cannulate at the common femoral artery. If you happen to cannulate over here and hit that superficial artery, you actually run a higher risk of complications such as aneurysms. Now, if you're doing this in short axis, that's where you want to have that transducer. If you want to place it in long axis, what you do is you just identify that femoral artery and then you will rotate it with a pro marker facing up towards the patient's head. And you see here that artery in long axis. And in this view, we can very easily see the common femoral branching off into the superficial and deep arterial branches. And that is how you evaluate a femoral artery for cannulation. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Right Kidney Longitudinal,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/kOpAjbrEQjufeudbsoJhdg,Renal,Right Kidney Longitudinal,Learn how to scan the right kidney in a longitudinal view,Adwana Clayton,3/22/2023,"I'm going to show you how to examine the right kidney using the butterfly. We want to make sure that we're in the abdomen preset. You can go ahead and tap the presets button and select abdomen. Once your preset is activated, we want to put some gel on our transducer. And I like to start right in the costal margin down here in the right flank. I'm going to go ahead and put my probe down. And if you're not seeing a lot of anything, you can go ahead and start to slide superiorly on the patient. And typically the first thing you're going to encounter here is going to be liver, which is good. It's a great landmark. As I continue moving up between the ribs here, I now encounter my right kidney, which we can see here. I want to make sure that I sweep through the entire kidney just to rule out any pathology. I'm just going to sweep laterally and coming back immediately by rocking my transducer. Once I feel like I've covered the entire kidney, I want to go ahead and get my kidney elongated so that I can take a measurement. Once I feel like I've got the greatest length, I'm going to go ahead and freeze my image. Here I'm just using the cine to bring it back to a spot where I feel like my image is nice and crisp. I'm going to go ahead and use my annotation and measurement tool to bring up line. We've got a couple of calipers here. I'm going to go ahead and take my first one and place it at the superior pull of the kidney. And I'll take my second one and place it here at the inferior pull of the kidney. And once I'm happy with the position of those calipers, I can go ahead and store an image. And our measurement is displayed at the bottom of the screen. It's 10 centimeters, which is a totally normal measurement for a kidney. We can also take an anterior posterior measurement of the kidney with the same image. I'm going to go ahead and tap on my annotation and measurement tool, bring up another line. And I'm going to go ahead and place my calipers in an anterior posterior fashion here. I've got a measurement of 4.4 centimeters, and if I'm happy with that, I can go ahead and store an image. I'm going to go ahead and unfreeze. Another thing that we want to make sure that we examine when we're looking at the kidney is we want to make sure that we look at the echogenicity of the kidney to make sure that it looks appropriate. We can see that the renal cortex is a bit darker, and the renal sinus is a bit brighter. And that's a normal appearance for a kidney. We don't want our renal cortex to get anywhere near the echogenicity of our renal sinus. Another thing that we can do as a comparison is compare the echogenicity of the liver to the renal cortex. We always want to make sure that the echogenicity of our renal cortex is either iso or hypo or coic to the echogenicity of our liver. And that's how we examine the right kidney using the butterfly.

Right Kidney Transverse,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/jzFGj9bXSoSsaFST_ECaJQ,Renal,Right Kidney Transverse,Learn how to scan the right kidney in a transverse view,Adwana Clayton,3/22/2023,"I'm going to demonstrate how to survey the right kidney in its short axis using the butterfly. I'm going to use the abdominal preset for this, so I'm going to go ahead and tap on the presets button and select abdomen. Once my preset is activated, I'm going to go ahead and place my transducer here at the mid-axillary line. And using my liver as a landmark, I'm going to go ahead and move inferiorly on my patient until I bump into my right kidney. Since we're in the short axis, the kidney is going to appear as a C-shaped structure. We can see that the renal cortex is the darker gray and our renal sinus is the lighter, brighter white color in the center of our C here. Once I locate my kidney, I'm going to go ahead and optimize my image by decreasing my depth. I'm also going to increase my gain, a small amount. And once I'm happy with the appearance of my image, I want to sweep through the entire kidney to make sure that I get a good look from multiple to rule out anything abnormal. I'm going to go ahead and angle towards my patient's head and slowly sweep down, moving through the kidney as I angle towards my patient's feet. Once I'm happy with that, and I feel like I visualize the whole kidney, I want to come back and get a good image at the midpoint. At the midpoint, we should see a C-shape with a break there in the center. We want to make sure that we have it relatively symmetrical. And once I get an image that I'm happy with, I'm going to go ahead and freeze. I'm going to use my Cine feature to move back a few frames. I'm going to go ahead and select that image and store it. I'm going to then tap on my annotation and measurement tool. And this is going to allow me to take a measurement of the width of my kidney here at its midpoint. I'm going to go ahead and grab my first caliper and place it at the edge of the renal cortex. And I'm going to take my second caliper and bring it right into the area where the kidney breaks to the edge of where the cortex would continue through. If I'm happy with that, I'm going to go ahead and take an image. And we can see the measurement on the bottom of the screen. In this case, it's 4.3 centimeters. And that's how you survey your right kidney in the short axis using the butterfly. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
LVOT variation of peak systolic velocity,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/E4O4ArKxTnivgZxR6RKB8A,Cardiac,LVOT variation of peak systolic velocity,Learn how to evaluate variability in peak systolic velocity through the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) with the Butterfly.,Adwana Clayton,2/22/2023,We are going to show you how to evaluate the variability in the peak systolic velocity through the LVOT. We do this specifically to look for the presence or absence of volume responsiveness in a critically ill patient. We have the cardiac preset selected and what Holly is going to do is she's going to get us an apical 5 chamber view of the heart. Once we find the appropriate window we want to optimize our image. After we get a view here what Holly is going to do is she's going to increase the gain just ever so size we get a better view excellent and now what we'll do is it will hit the actions button and select the post Doppler function and place that post Doppler gate just proximal to the aortic valve in the LVOT. Now we'll hit start spectrum and we're getting away from now it's a little bit faint so what we can do here is we can increase the gain by swapping right and we're getting a good waveform here. Now we're seeing just five beats we want more of them so the way that we change the sweep speed is we're going to hit that fast scroll button it's going to switch it to slow scroll which is going to give us a lot more beats here after we get a tracing of the post Doppler signal. Now if we notice right here we kind of have lost the signal which happens very frequently if that happens just go ahead and update that B mode setting which is what Holly is going to do right here and make sure that our Doppler gate is in the appropriate area right there and then let's give it another shot and right there way better signal we're in the appropriate spot right in the center we're going to nice hollow waveform and once we get a good tracing go ahead and hit that freeze button and then we can relax the probe hand. What we do here is we want to make sure to measure the highest peak systolic velocity and then the lowest systolic velocity that we have off of this tracing and we can identify the presence or options of volume response into this way after we get our waveform now we're going to measure the peak velocities hit the annotation and distance button hit the line tool and then let's pick our highest peak right now so I think yep I think it's probably that one will start off with our first measurement at the baseline there and then put the second at the peak and then the lowest one I think it's probably that one right there is going to be our lowest peak velocity and we start at the base right there and then we are going to bring that second one over to the end of it right there that's a little adjustment and now we have our two values we have at 94 centimeters per second and 72 centimeters per second and the way we calculate percents change is the biggest number minus the smallest number over the biggest number times that by 100 and that will give us the percent change in the peaks of solid velocity through the LVOT and that is how you use your butterfly to measure the variation in the peaks of solid velocity using your apical 5 chamber view
IVC - Percent Collapse,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/VIfy12aYQwWcz4qRtEL4fg,Cardiac,IVC - Percent Collapse,Learn how to identify the percent collapse of the inferior vena cava (IVC) using the Butterfly,Adwana Clayton,2/22/2023,"I'm going to show you how to identify the percent collapse of the inferior vena cava using your butterfly. Make sure that you have the appropriate preset selected by hitting the preset button and selecting abdomen. If you have trouble with this view on the abdomen setting, you can always select abdomen deep, but for this exam, we are going to use abdomen. The first step is going to be identifying the inferior vena cava. We're going to do that by placing the transducer in the sub-ziofoid area with the pro marker facing up towards the patient's head. The first blood vessel that we are identifying right here in the center of the screen is a pulsatile blood vessel with thick walls. And as we track it more cephalad, we are going to see that it is actually going posterior to that heart. This is not the IVC. This is the aorta. We are going to bring our transducer over towards the patient's right. And then we can see another blood vessel that is the IVC. We can see it going directly into that right atrium. Now I'm going to rotate my transducer to try and get that IVC perfectly into that long axis. We don't want to see any pinching off of one end or the other because that can mean that we're oblique with the axis of that IVC. Once we identify the IVC, we are going to decrease our depth just a tad bit and adjust our gain. And we're going to have our patient go through a few respiratory cycles, maybe one or two, and just watch it as they go through that respiratory cycle. And once they have about one or two respiratory cycles complete, now we're going to do our calculation. Hit that freeze button right there and then you can remove the transducer. Now it's very important that we don't use the M mode function for this specific measurement. The reason why is the IVC actually moves quite a bit due to the fact that it's tethered to the diaphragm. If we use M mode, we are actually going to be measuring two completely different areas of that IVC, which would give us an inaccurate measurement. After you've hit that freeze button, what we're going to do is we're going to identify the smallest caliber and the highest caliber diameter size of that IVC. I'm going to hit the time button and I'm going to scrub through until I get to the smallest caliber. So that's what we're seeing right here. After we have identified the smallest caliber, we're going to hit the select button here. So it freezes there and now we're going to do our measurement. We want to identify a location to measure at two centimeters from the right atrial junction. So we'll hit our line and annotate button. We're going to hit the line tool and we're going to place one end of this line right at the junction of the right atrium and the IVC and the second line, we are going to identify a location two centimeters from that place. It doesn't have to be exact. We're going to get to 2.06 close enough and at that location is where we're going to measure the diameter. So we're going to hit that button again. We're going to press the line tool and we're going to measure the diameter right at that location. So we got there and there. So our first number that we have obtained is .34 as our smallest caliber. We're going to hit our camera button to save it and then we're going to delete our measurements to get our second number. We're going to hit that time button again and now we're going to select the largest caliber of that IVC. So right about here we have our largest caliber and we basically do the exact same thing. So we'll select, we'll hit the annotation and line button. We're going to identify a location two centimeters from the right atrial IVC junction. All right there and then we'll go ahead and hit that again to measure that diameter. And our second measurement here is 1.61. To measure the percent change, what we're going to do is we're going to take our biggest number minus our smallest number, divide that by our biggest number and multiply that by 100. And that's how we use the butterfly to identify the percent collapse of the IVC. >> Okay."
Appendix,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/wDoDzgwLQIC0z7Tf1y_BmA,Gastrointestinal,Appendix,Learn how to scan the appendix using the Butterfly.,Adwana Clayton,2/22/2023,"I'm going to show you how to identify the appendix using the butterfly. Typically when we are evaluating abdominal structures, we want to be in the abdomen setting. However, with the evaluation of the appendix, we're going to be a little more superficial and looking at a small structure. So the best setting to use is going to actually be your MSK soft tissue setting, which you select by hitting the preset button. There are quite a few protocols that you can use to identify where the appendix is, but I like to start by identifying the Eliac artery as my initial landmark. We are going to have our transducer in a pencil grip with a pro marker facing over to the patient's right. And we're going to place that transducer right in the right lower quadrant, identifying the Eliac artery, which we are seeing right here. We are going to maximize our image by slightly increasing our gain. And we're going to apply a little bit of pressure here to make sure that we can get that bowel gas out of our window. After I've identified the Eliac artery, I am going to now track up and down on that Eliac artery, seeing a bit of bowel gas right there. And then here, we're again able to see that Eliac artery. I'm going to slowly track that Eliac artery and try and identify where that appendix might be. Oftentimes, we see it in relation to that Eliac artery, which is why we're using that as our window. Now we're having a bit of artifact from the bowel right there. And it's obscuring our image, which honestly happens fairly frequently. There's a couple of different ways that you can kind of get around it. What I am doing right now is I'm actually just applying a little more pressure to help me bowel kind of parasols out of the way of the window. And as I do that, I am now able to see a circular structure, just superior and lateral towards the right of that Eliac artery. See it right there. I'm going to decrease my depth just a little bit there to evaluate it a little bit further. And there's a circular structure there that I believe is the appendix. Now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to watch it and I'm going to hold pressure to make sure that it does not parasols out of the way, which we are not seeing here. As I track it, I can see that it actually is contiguous with that chunk of bowel right here that we're seeing with that air artifact, which is the CECOM. After you've identified the structure that you believe is the appendix, go ahead and hit that freeze button right there and then go ahead and measure that diameter. We're going to hit our annotations and line tool, select the line tool and measure the diameter of the appendix. We're going to want to make sure to measure the outer wall to outer wall to get an accurate measurement and in this specific case, we are seeing a diameter of 0.26 centimeters. And that's how you use the butterfly to identify the appendix. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Liver Measurement,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/gyT8KgDxSPOId29t6Xlctg,Tropical Medicine,Liver Measurement,Learn how to examine the liver texture and assess for hepatomegaly using the Butterfly.,Adwana Clayton,2/22/2023,"We're going to use the butterfly to examine the texture of the liver and assess for hepato megalae. First, tap the presets button and choose abdomen for preset. Place your probe in the costal margin and your patient can be supine or in this left lateral decubidus position. Here we see the normal liver including the bright hypercoic diaphragm, the normal liver and the kidney over on the right side of the screen. An easy assessment of the size of the liver is to measure and assess the inferior edge of the liver by sliding your probe inferiorly. I'm going to change our gain a little bit. Here is the inferior edge of the liver and here is the inferior edge of the kidney. In most patients, a normal sized liver will not pass inferior to the inferior edge of the kidney. And in fact, in most patients, the inferior edge of this liver should not pass beyond the halfway point of the kidney. Here we see the inferior edge of this patient's liver and this patient's kidney. To make actual measurement, which sometimes can be subjective, try to get it all in one screen, your diaphragm and the entire liver with relation to the kidney. Take a deep breath in and hold it. There you go. And exhale. I'm going to cine back a little bit and then use my measurement tool to measure the liver edge from the diaphragm to the tip of the liver. And that's how you assess for hepatomegaly using your butterfly. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Corrected Flow Time (cFT) - Common Carotid Artery,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/ULEQ7b80QaWTpg9ljjtZdA,Arterial,Corrected Flow Time (cFT) - Common Carotid Artery,Learn how to calculate the corrected flow time of the carotid artery with the Butterfly.,Adwana Clayton,2/22/2023,I'm going to show you how to calculate the corrected flow time of the carotid artery. Make sure that you have the appropriate preset by hitting the preset button and selecting your carotid preset. Next have your patient rotate their head a little bit away from you and you want to use your transducer and a bit of a pencil grip and you want to place it just on the lateral aspect of the neck right around there. We're seeing a couple of structures here. We're seeing the sternocledomastoid muscle up top. We see the jugular vein here and then right there that circular hypocoic structure is the carotid artery which we are seeing in the short axis. We want to identify where the bulb is in the carotid artery which is the area of the common carotid right before it splits into the internal and external carotid arteries. So we're going to track that up towards the jaw and right there we're seeing to get a little bit bigger and then split off into those two branches. We'll come back a little more approximately and then we'll rotate our transducer to see the carotid artery in the long axis. After you have the carotid in the long axis you want to tilt it either towards the head or down to get a little more of an angle of that carotid artery to get a good pull stop alert signal. You'll hit the actions button and then hit pull stop alert and place the stop alert gate right in the center of that lumen. We're going to change our angle just a little bit to make sure that we are parallel with that blood vessel. We're seeing here let's try to make sure we get it right in the center to get that laminar flow and then we're going to hit the start spectrum button. And here we're getting our waveform and once we get a couple of spikes there we're going to then hit freeze and do our time calculation. The way that we do that is we're going to hit our label and measure button right here and we are going to calculate two things. The first one is going to be the time insistally. We're going to find the beginning of that first big spike and then we are going to find the dichrotic notch which dichrotic notch is that little notch right here. So we're going to place that right where that dichrotic notch is and we're getting a time of 0.32 seconds. That's our first number and our second one is actually going to be the entire cycle time. What I usually do with that is I go to our line tool here and I will pick the peak of one of those systolic spikes towards the peak of the other one and that gives us the cycle time and then we have a time of 1.05 seconds. The calculation that we want to use is the corrected flow time calculation. There are many but the one that is in the literature most commonly is going to be the time insistally divided by the square root of the entire cycle time and that will give you the corrected flow time. And that's how you use your butterfly to calculate the corrected flow time of the carotid artery. [BLANK_AUDIO]
Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI),https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/cV11gax-Shy_tMyu49jaVQ,OB/GYN,Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI),Learn how to measure AFI with the Butterfly.,Adwana Clayton,2/22/2023,"We're going to use the butterfly to measure AFI amniotic fluid index in the third trimester. We will be in the OB23 preset and before we start our scanning, we're going to hit actions and amniotic fluid index, which appears at the bottom of the screen. Now we're ready to make our measurements. Imagine the mother's uterus in four separate quadrants. We're going to find a pocket of fluid in each quadrant and add up the measurements. The machine will save them. We're going to start in the maternal right lower quadrant. I'm in a sagittal plane of scanning with the probe marker towards the mother's head. I scan in the quadrant to look for fluid. Here I see a fluid pocket, but within it there is the umbilical cord, so we can't use that. Here I think I see a good pocket, but I'm going to apply color to assess the pocket. Because I see color, I know there's an umbilical cord in that pocket, so we cannot use it. Here in the right lower quadrant, I can use this pocket. There's no color, so there's no umbilical cord. I'm going to go ahead and make my measurement. I'll hit freeze, and then the measurement icon, and this will be considered quadrant 1. I'll move my calipers to the lower edge of the placenta here, and then a straight vertical measurement to the first area where I see any non-fluid structure. This measurement is 4.79 centimeters. I'm going to confirm the measurement, and next move on towards scanning again. We're going to move towards the maternal right upper quadrant next. Here again I have the color box present to assess for any umbilical cord. Over here we can see some umbilical cord in our view, so we won't measure there. But I do see a pocket of fluid here that we can use. I'm going to go ahead and hit freeze, and the measurement icon, Q2, and measure this small pocket here, 2.49 centimeters. I'll hit confirm. We're going to move on now, I'm going to unfreeze to the maternal left upper quadrant. Here in this quadrant, this is mostly baby. I'm going to get rid of the color doppler for a second. Here we see baby's bladder and baby's body, so there is not a big pocket for us to measure, and that's okay. There's a small pocket for us to measure. Again I'm going to hit freeze, and then the measurement icon, Q3, and I'm going to move my calipers to make a measurement there, and hit confirm. I'm going to unfreeze and go to the final quadrant. This will be the maternal left lower quadrant. Again, my probe is in the sagittal plane with the marker up towards mom's head. Again, this is mostly baby's back. We can see the ribs, the fetal heart, and we have a very tiny pocket of fluid there. I'm going to change my depth a little bit, and then I'm going to go ahead and hit freeze, use my measurement icon to hit Q4, and move the calipers to make a measurement of this pocket. 2.45 centimeters, I'll confirm that. Taken together, these are all the amniotic fluid index measurements. Now to see the final calculation of the total AFI, which measures 1, 2, 3, and 4, and tallies the final AFI for you, hit the number in the corner. This is all of your notes, scroll down to see all of your calculations that you have saved. So we'll save the study. Once you've saved your study, return to your home screen and press freeze. This brings up the final total of the amniotic fluid index in the bottom corner. Here we see it's normal at 13.67 centimeters. If you swipe up on this image, you can see each individual measure that you made in each quadrant of the mother's uterus, and delete any that you would like to repeat. This is how you use your butterfly to calculate the amniotic fluid index. [BLANK_AUDIO]"

First we need to make sure we're on the right preset. So I'll select the preset button and cardiac. Then I'm going to place my transducer down on the patient right in the midline. I normally like to feel for the xifoid process and place my probe just under that. Orientation marker will be toward the patient's left. I have my hand on top of the transducer because I'm going to be angling up really steep. My hand we're holding it this way, it would get in the way. So hand on top of the transducer and then you're going to do kind of a scooping motion up toward the heart. And here her subcostal view is really pretty. It pops right into view. I'm just going to increase my gain and my depth a little. If you don't get an easy subcostal view this way, some tips you can try is to have your patient take in a big deep breath and hold it. Go ahead. And what that does is it just pushes the heart down a little bit closer to your transducer so you're able to crisp up that image and get a better subcostal view. Go ahead and breathe. And I'm applying quite a bit of pressure under the xifoid process here to get that image. Then also another trick that you can do is to have your patient bend their knees up and that relieves some of the abdominal pressure and allows you to press down into the subcostal view a little bit easier. And that is how you obtain a subcostal view using the butterfly. [BLANK_AUDIO]"

First off, make sure that you have the correct preset selected. We're going to go to our MSK soft tissue selection, and we are going to identify the esophagus. We'll start off by placing our transducer at about the mid level of the neck on the lateral aspect, and we're going to see a few structures. We have the sternocutter mastoid up top, we have the carotid, we have the IJ. We are going to move into the trachea. This hyperacolic ring represents the air in the trachea. We can track that up and down, and then what we're going to do is look a little lateral and look for the esophagus, which we're able to see right there. Now, when we are using this for the assessment of adequate endotracheal tube placement, we just want to see movement and manipulation inside the trachea. If we see the esophagus start to get bigger and move, and that become a second trachea, then unfortunately we have a esophageal intubation, which is not where we want the endotracheal tube. Now, just to demonstrate how the esophagus can look, we're going to go ahead and swallow, and we see that we saw motion and that esophagus gets slightly bigger. So if we ever have any trouble, that's how we can identify it. Most of the time, we're going to see esophagus on the left part of the neck, but occasionally it will be behind, it will be over to the right. If you can't identify it, what you do is you just hold a little bit of pressure, and that will actually push the esophagus out from underneath that trachea. And that's how you use the butterfly to assess for adequate placement of an endotracheal tube. We'll see you next week on our"
Femoral Artery Peak Systolic Velocity,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/AsGg6btdQC-kAxFIvXM46A,Arterial,Femoral Artery Peak Systolic Velocity,Learn how to use the Butterfly to obtain the peak systolic velocity of the femoral artery to assess for volume responsiveness.,Adwana Clayton,2/14/2023,"This is how you evaluate the patient's femoral artery for volume responsiveness. Make sure that you're in the appropriate setting by hitting the presets button and selecting vascular carotid. This probe marker needs to go over towards the patient's right side. If they can, have the patient externally rotate their leg and place a transducer at about the mid thigh just underneath the inguinal ligament. Right here we are seeing some hypoacolic blood vessels to differentiate the artery from the vein. Go ahead and hold down some general pressure. The pulsatile vessel is the artery, the non-pulsatile vessel is going to be the vein. Once we have identified our artery, let's go ahead and rotate the transducer to the probe marker up towards the patient's head to get that femoral artery into the long access. We can see here that we have the common femoral with the superficial and deep femoral right there. What we want to do is focus in on the common femoral. I'm going to optimize my image a little bit by decreasing my depth and lowering my gain. It's a little bright. The next step is going to be selecting our actions button, hitting that pulse doppler button and placing the pulse wave doppler gate just in the center of that lumen. We can actually adjust the angle right here to make sure that we're parallel to that blood vessel. And then we are going to hit that start spectrum button. We are seeing some good spikes right there. I like to see the largest spike go above the baseline. So I'm going to hit the invert button and there we have the spike above the baseline. If we want to adjust the sweep speed, we'll go ahead and change this. If we want to adjust our image, we can change it from high flow to low flow. Low flow is going to be a better setting for this. And then once we have a good amount of pulse doppler spikes, we will hit that freeze button. The next thing that we need to do is go ahead and measure the peaks of the highest velocity with the lowest velocity. And we do that by hitting the measure button, hit the line button and then find your biggest spike, which I'm going to say is this one right here. So that's going to be our peak. And then with our lowest velocity, I'm going to pick this one right here. And now we have our two velocities. To measure percent change, we're going to take our biggest number minus our smallest number over our biggest number times it by 100. And that's how we get the percent change. And it helps us figure out if the patient is falling responsive or not. And that's how we use the butterfly to evaluate the patient's femoral artery for volume responsiveness. [BLANK_AUDIO]"

The first thing that we're going to want to do is make sure that we are on the appropriate preset. So I'm going to hit the preset button and make sure that I'm on the vascular access setting. As far as patient positioning, what you should do is have the patient externally rotate the leg that you are trying to cannulate. As far as where to place the transducer, you want to aim for about midline to the upper thigh, just inferior to the Inuit and Legament with a pro marker facing over towards the patient's right. Now we are seeing a bit of muscle up here. I'm going to move a little more laterally. And now we are seeing some hypoecolic discs right there. And these are the blood vessels. Now to tell the difference between the artery and the vein, what we should do is do some compression. So as I hold down pressure, we can see that the veins completely collapse and the artery, while this collapse a bit, it doesn't completely collapse and it begins to pulsate. That's how we tell the difference. So let's look at the vein right here. We're going to put it right in the center and I'm going to optimize my image a bit. So I'm going to increase the depth just a tad bit right there. And I'm going to increase the gain a little bit. And if we see here, the near field has a good amount of brightness, but our far field is maybe a little darker. So we can do is we can tap the screen, hit this button down here, the TGC or time gain compensation button, and we'll just increase our far gain right there. So what we want to do next is we want to identify the common femoral vein right about here. We don't want to cannulate it right here where we have the branch where between the superficial and the deep veins, we want to cannulate it up here. Now, if you want to cannulate it in the short axis, you can go ahead and cannulate it right there. And if you want to cannulate it in the long axis, what we do is we rotate the transducer with a pro marker facing up towards the patient's head right here. And now we can see that femoral vein in the long axis, and we want to cannulate it about right there where we have the common femoral vein. And that is how we evaluate the femoral vein for central venous cannulation. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Central Venous Access - Internal Jugular Vein,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/x6CLQvIyQ76gMpH6RmoyHQ,Vascular Access,Central Venous Access - Internal Jugular Vein,Learn how to identify the internal jugular vein for central venous access with the Butterfly.,Adwana Clayton,2/14/2023,"I'm going to show you how to evaluate the internal jugular vein for central venous catheterization. Make sure that your butterfly device is in the vascular access setting right there. And then grab your transducer in a pencil grip. Now the placement of the tablet or smart device that you're going to be using is actually very important for this. What we want to do is we want to make sure that we have a good line of sight. We have our tablet here just because it's best for the cameras, but ideally we should have the tablet here so that as I'm doing my procedure of the right IJ, I'm able to look up and look down and that just gives us a better line of sight. We're going to start off by evaluating the IJ or the internal jugular vein in the short access. So our transducer is going to go on the patient's neck at about the mid neck area. When doing this procedure, your probe marker actually needs to be, if you're doing the right IJ, it actually needs to be to the patient's left, which is different than we normally do because we want our probe marker, which we're seeing right here, to line up with our probe marker on the screen so that if we go left, it's going to go left on the screen and when we go right, it's going to be right on the screen. Now we have identified our internal jugular vein. It's that structure right there in the center. We have our sternocleto mastoid right above that. We can do a little compression and we can see that the carotid artery does not compress. It becomes very pulsatile and then we have our internal jugular just lateral to that. This right here, this orientation between the jugular and the carotid artery is great. They are side by side. There is no overlap. This would be an appropriate position to perform your cannulation right here. Now what we don't want is we don't want to cannulate ever when we have this orientation right here. So notice that when I have my probe lateral, we see that the IJ is directly on top of that carotid artery, which this is not ideal because if you happen to go through that posterior wall, you might accidentally cannulate that carotid artery, which we definitely want to avoid. This orientation creates a much safer environment for catheterization. So we've identified that jugular vein and we know that we're in the appropriate location. The next step is understanding the path, making sure that we're always going parallel to that vein. So we're going to go up and down the neck and notice as I go up and down the neck, that jugular vein is staying right in the center of my screen, which is great. We're going to keep our transducer there and we know that if we bring our needle in and a perpendicular access to that transducer, we're going to in fact be parallel to that vein, which will maximize our success. That is the approach in the short access. If we're doing this in the long access, the first part is exactly the same. Make sure that your jugular vein is lateral or besides that carotid artery. And once we've centered that jugular vein, then we go ahead and we're going to rotate our transducer, probe marker facing up towards the patient's head. We find that IJ in the long access right there and then we can go ahead and perform our cannulation in the long access. And that's how we use the butterfly to evaluate the internal jugular vein for central venous catheterization. [BLANK_AUDIO]"

Make sure that you're on the appropriate setting. I'm going to select the presets button and scroll towards the abdomen setting. You can use the abdomen deep when necessary but for this specific case we are going to use our abdomen setting. Next what we're going to do is we are going to place the transducer on the patient. Pro marker up towards the patient's head and you are going to place it just in that sub-xyphoid area. And we are seeing a structure here. We are seeing a hypoecolic linear structure and what we should talk about now is how to differentiate between the aorta and the IVC. This structure right here it has hypericolic walls it is much more pulsatile but the main thing that I look for is what happens to it in relation to the heart. We can see the heart here on the left side of the screen and we can see this blood vessel which is the aorta going posterior to that heart going deep to it going behind it. This is the normal path of the aorta. So what I'm going to do next is I'm going to move my transducer over to the patient's right and now I'm seeing a different blood vessel. This is the IVC. I know it's the IVC because I can see it going directly into the heart and I can see that hepatic vein. That's this guy right there that is going right into that IVC right before the junction between the right atrium and the IVC. We can also evaluate in the short axis by turning the transducer over towards the patient's right and we can see the aorta on the patient's left right there to screen right. We can see the IVC there on the patient's right or the left side of the screen. Deep to that we can see the hyperacolic cortex of the vertebral bodies with acoustic shadow and going deep to that and we can actually track that all the way down until we get to the lower abdomen. And that is how we use the butterfly to identify the inferior vena cava.

We are going to make sure that we have the appropriate preset selected by selecting the cardiac preset and then we are going to get a subcostal view of that heart. Once you place that transducer in the sub xyphoid area we're going to flatten our tail a bit to get a good view of that heart and then we're going to have our patient take a breath in and hold it. We are going to decrease our depth and we're going to hit freeze. Now the reason that we are zooming in or decreasing our depth so much is really we don't need to see the entire heart for this specific measurement. We only care about looking at that right ventricle. Now once we have this view we want to identify when it diastole is or when the heart is going to be the most filled which would give us the smallest diameter of that wall. We're going to hit that time button and we're basically going to cycle back to when we see the valves nice and open right about there excellent and then we are going to hit our annotations and lines tool and we are going to measure the diameter from outer wall to inner wall of that RV free wall. We see here a measurement of 0.89 centimeters and that's how you measure the RV free wall thickness using the butterfly.

First, we want to make sure we're on the appropriate preset, preset, abdomen. And a lot of times we go straight for the midline, but a secondary view you can use is a trans hepatic view. So I'm going to place the probe in the mid-axillary line over on the patient's right with the orientation marker toward the patient's head. So I put the probe down and immediately I see liver tissue, and just far to that I see this long vessel and that's the IVC. To confirm that's the IVC, if I just slide superior a little bit, we can see the hepatic veins going right into the IVC. And then also if you notice in the far field, see a pulsatile vessel and that's the aorta that it sits right next to. And that is how we visualize a trans hepatic IVC using the butterfly.

I'm going to go ahead and tap my presets button and select abdomen. And once my preset is activated, I'm going to start at the patient's midline with my indicator towards the patient's head. This is going to allow us to perform a sagittal sweep of our liver. Looking at the patient's midline, we can see the left lobe of the liver peeking in. So I'm going to go ahead and fan my probe. And as I'm fanning the probe towards my patient's right, we can see that we're moving through the left lobe of our liver. We want to make sure that we cover the liver in its entirety. So as I sweep, I'm going to watch for some landmarks. Here we can see our aorta. If I continue towards my patient's right, we're going to bump into the vena cava. And if I continue to sweep, we're going to enter the right lobe. Now you might notice that we start to lose a little bit of definition here. When I get to the point where I start to lose a little bit of definition, I'm going to go ahead and change windows. I'm going to move a bit lateral. And I like to start at the costal margin. And here we can see the right lobe of the liver entering our field of view. And if I continue to angle towards my patient's right, I can fan the probe and examine the liver, echotexture, as I sweep back and forth. If I'm not able to see the liver all the way to the diaphragm, I'm going to go ahead, change windows one more time, and come a bit more laterally into the costal spaces. And here we can see the diaphragm, and that's letting me know that I've seen the entire right lobe of the liver. Once I've completed my survey in the sagittal plane, I'm going to come back to midline because I want to also cover the liver in the short axis. So I'm going to have the probe indicator pointed towards my patient's right. Starting at the midline, I can now fan superior to inferior and sweep through my left lobe. Once I'm satisfied that I visualize my left lobe, I'm going to come back to my costal margin, and I'm going to go ahead and using the same fanning motion, sweep through the right lobe of the liver, superiorly to inferiorly. And once again, if I feel like I'm not getting complete visualization of the diaphragm, I'm going to come a bit more laterally and go ahead and perform that same motion to ensure that I'm seeing the whole right lobe of the liver.

Here we see the fetal body, plenty of amniotic fluid and an active baby, kicking and here this echodence kind of gray structure on the deep part of the screen, which represents the posterior aspect of uterus, is the placenta. As I scan inferiorly, I note that the placenta remains posterior. It's important to find the inferior edge of the placenta and see if it approaches the mother's cervical aus to diagnose conditions such as low lying or placenta previa. Here we see the placenta still, despite the probe being quite low. I'm going to turn into a sagittal plane, decrease my gain a little bit. Here we see the mother's bladder, the baby's head, and here the baby's head is shadowing somewhat, this placenta. So I'm going to move my probe. Here again we see placenta.

First, we want to make sure we're on the right preset. So I'm going to tap the presets button. I'm going to select ""optimal."" Next, how I like to find the gallbladder on my patients is to start kind of in the midline and then sweep down through the liver. All right, so I'm going to start midline and sweep along the liver until I see the gallbladder pop in. And here we have it in the long access. My patient's comfortable. She's just breathing normally and I can see the gallbladder really well. If you are having a hard time getting the gallbladder visualized well, you can have your patient take in a big deep breath and hold it. Go ahead and do that. So it just kind of clears everything up. I'm going to sweep through the gallbladder and the long access here. We'll have to write. And then I'm going to turn my probe 90 degrees and sweep through in the transverse. Fund is to neck. When you're sweeping through, you're looking for any mobile stones, any stones that are shattering, any sludge. Once you've assessed the gallbladder pretty well, you can look for the common bile duct. So I'm going to have my patient take in another big deep breath and hold it. And here we see the portal vein. I'm going to turn on color doppler by hitting the actions tab, color doppler, freeze. And that'll help identify the common bile duct versus any other surrounding vessels. Go ahead and breathe. So once you've swept through the gallbladder and you've assessed the common bile duct, you always want to roll your patient as well because there could be some stones stuck down in the gallbladder neck that you're not able to catch. So I'm going to have you roll up onto your left side. I'm going to place my probe in the same spot. And again, just sweep through looking for any sort of stones or sludge or shadowing. Both in long and transverse. Right now I'm just rotating my transducer to look at the long axis of the gallbladder. And I have looked through in both left lateral dequeve position and supine.

As I scan back and forth in the right lower quadrant I see babies head and babies back but not much fluid so I'm not going to measure there. Next I'm going to move to the right upper quadrant of the uterus. Again we see babies heart, babies body but not much fluid so we're not going to measure there. In the third trimester it's pretty common to have one half of the uterus be filled with baby and the other half have some fluid placenta and cord. Here we see an anterior placenta and we're starting to see these dark pockets so we could measure here but we'll come back to that. We're going to check the last left lower quadrant here. Again we see anterior placenta, babies face and a small pocket of fluid. Here we see a pocket of fluid with the umbilical cord in it so we aren't going to measure there. We want to find a pocket of fluid that does not have cord. I'm going to go back up to this left upper quadrant of the uterus. Once I find a pocket that I'm happy with I'm going to hit freeze and then I'm going to choose the measurement button at the bottom of the screen and choose line. I'm going to place my caliper from the top of the screen where the fluid pocket starts to where the first part of the visible part of the fetus or non-fluid structure is.

The best setting for this is going to be the MSK soft tissue setting. You can also use the lung setting as well to help you identify the air within the trachea, but today we are going to use the soft tissue setting. What we're going to do is we're going to identify the Crycothyroid membrane by identifying midline and identifying the Crycothyroid membrane with the sagittal orientation. So if you can have the patient extend their neck by putting a pillow or a shoulder roll underneath their shoulders, and then we're going to place that transducer transverse over the anterior trachea with a probe marker over to the patient's right. So we are seeing a hyperacolic rim right there, this is the apex of the trachea, and we are going to mark midline with our skin marker at that location. So we'll center it here. Actually, what I'm going to do is I'm going to put my midline to help me identify exactly where midline is, and now I'm going to mark that location on the skin surface itself. Now that we have midline, what we're going to do is identify the Crycothyroid membrane itself by looking on the anterior neck with a probe marker up towards the patient's head. This structure right here is the thyroid cartilage, and then we are going to move it to right a little more inferiorly. We see another cartilage in the ring right there. This white line, that is the Crycothyroid membrane. Once we have placed that in midline, we are going to do another skin marker at that location, and then we can put the probe down. We can see here that we have a mark for midline, and we have a mark for the Crycothyroid membrane. We can extrapolate and know that right there is going to be the location for our Crycothyroid membrane. And that is how you use the butterfly to identify the Crycothyroid membrane. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Focused Assessment with Sonography for HIV/TB (FASH) Exam,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/xJcxpiVmROyHPac0HBQ14w,Tropical Medicine,Focused Assessment with Sonography for HIV/TB (FASH) Exam,Learn how to perform the Focused Assessment with Sonography for HIV/TB (FASH) exam with the Butterfly.,Adwana Clayton,1/9/2023,"We're going to use the butterfly to perform the FASH exam. That stands for Focus Assessment with Synography and HIV and TB Co-infection. We're going to start in the abdomen preset. And we're going to perform an exam to evaluate for pericardial effusion. I'm going to do this from the sub-zipheoid view. I place my probe in the sub-zipheoid region, and I'm flattening the angle to aim the probe towards the left chest. Here I see the heart, but I do not see the pericardium that is in the superior portion of our model and the inferior area of the screen. So I'm going to increase my depth. Now I can see the bright white pericardium flush up against the gray myocardium all the way around the heart. And there is no pericardial effusion. Once I'm satisfied that there is not a pericardial effusion, I can move on to the search for plural effusion. I'm going to place my probe in the right flank in the lower costal margin. Here we can see diaphragm, liver, and kidney. I'll slide my probe superiorly over one rib to look at the area that is superior to the diaphragm. Here we see normal tissue and the absence of plural effusion. If I slide my probe inferiorly, I can look for ascites. I'm going to look for ascites between the liver and kidney in Morrison's pouch, which is the most dependent area in a supine patient. And then I'm going to slide my probe further inferiorly to look for fluid or ascites around the liver tip. Here, or around the inferior pole of the kidney here. I'm going to further look for ascites in the paracolic gutter. Here we just see a normal bowel gas pattern. From the right flank, I'm now going to look for any abnormalities of the parencoma, of the liver, or for hepatomegaly. Here we see the diaphragm, the liver, and the kidney again. And this would be a good area to measure for hepatomegaly. We're going to scan through the right side of the liver to look at overall echotexture of the liver. Here we can see normal parencoma, hepatic vasculature, and as I scan anteriorly, I have a good look through at least the right lobe of the liver. To fully interrogate the liver, or if you don't get a good view from the right side, you can also look in the mid-clavicular line, or in the patient's epigastrium, to do a full evaluation of the liver. Now, we're going to interrogate the left side. To evaluate for plural effusion and splenic abnormalities as well as ascites, I'm going to place my probe in the left flank, in the post-apocalyptic lab. In the posterior axillary line, here we can see the patient's spleen, a bit of the diaphragm, and some bowel gas. I can slide my probe superiorly to look for plural effusion, not seen here above the diaphragm. I can look for ascites between the spleen and the kidney, in the splenorhenyl pouch, seen here. And I can slide my probe inferiorly to look at the area around the kidney and in the paracolic gutter here to look for ascites. Here we see a normal bowel gas pattern and no ascites. I'm going to place my probe back into the left flank to assess the echotexture of the spleen. The spleen should appear homogenous and gray, as we see here, and I can jump superiorly over a rib, or inferiorly to look at different portions of the spleen. Occasionally the spleen is obscured by air in the chest. Once we're satisfied that we've seen the texture of the spleen and there are no prankamole abnormalities that are easily visualized, we can move on. In this portion of the FASH exam, we are going to look for abdominal adenopathy near the aorta. For this part of the exam, we'll place our probe in an axial plane in the sub-zive-foid region. Here we can see inferior vena cava, aorta, and the vertebral body with its associated shadow. I'm going to apply gentle pressure and move my probe inferiorly along the aorta. We are looking near the aorta for several lymph nodes. If we see several enlarged lymph nodes, that would be indicative of adenopathy, which could be associated with tuberculosis. We're going to finish our evaluation for ascites with a final pelvic view and look deep to the bladder. The probe is placed in the super pubic region and I will aim my probe inferiorly. I'm going to increase my depth so that we can look at the area deep to the bladder for ascites. Here we see that area is a bit over gained, so I'm going to turn down our overall gain and fan through to look for ascites or fluid outside of the bladder, which we do not see. And that completes our evaluation for ascites. And that is how you perform the FASH exam with your butterfly. [BLANK_AUDIO]"

First you'll choose the cardiac preset. Your patient can be laying flat or in the left lateral decubitous position. You'll place the probe on the chest in the left of sternum area in the inframamory or nipple line. You may have to choose a rib space above or below the area you first place the probe down in order to find the optimal rib space to scan the heart in. Once you choose your rib space you can optimize your image by choosing an appropriate depth and an appropriate gain. In a peristernal long view you'll see the pericardium which appears bright white and hypercoic. You'll see the left ventricle but not including the left ventricular apex. The right ventricle, the outflow area, the aorta including the aortic valve, the mitral valve, both the posterior and anterior leaflets and deep to the heart you'll see the descending thoracic aorta which will appear as a hypoacolic circular structure and that's how you perform a peristernal long axis view using the butterfly."
Consensual Light Reflex Exam,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/YYpnEfu5RNm0Qi_gLak99Q,Ocular,Consensual Light Reflex Exam,Learn how to perform consensual light reflex exam with ultrasound,Adwana Clayton,12/12/2022,I'm going to show you how to perform a consensual light reflex examination using the butterfly. Now we have already placed the clear adhesive dressing over the eye that we're going to evaluate and what we're going to have the patient do next is actually close their eyes and have him with the eyes closed look down towards their feet. Just consistently just stay keep those eyes all the way looking down that way. Now normally when we're doing an eye examination we want to place a transducer over this superior eyelid with the tail basically up but to evaluate the pupil we actually need to angle the tail more towards the head and the beam a little more anterior and then there we're able to see the pupil right there on the iris. We're going to increase our gain just a tad bit and then we are going to shine light onto the closed eye and look for any change in the size. Right there we see some movement now pull it off the eye. Now back on the eye what we have visualized and right there we see movement of that pupil which confirms that the patient does have an intact consensual light reflex and that's how you use your butterfly to evaluate the consensual light reflex.

Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE),https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/rlLOWHzfSsmkly-qGazdZg,Cardiac,Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE),Learn how to obtain a TAPSE calculation using the Butterfly,Adwana Clayton,12/12/2022,"We are going to show you how to calculate the TAP-C or Tricuspid Annual Plane of Cystolic Excursion. The first thing that we're going to want to do is make sure that we're on the appropriate preset by hitting that preset button and selecting Cardiac and next Holly is going to show us how to obtain an apical 4-chamber view. After we get that apical 4-chamber view we can optimize our image just a tad bit by maneuvering the transducer changing the gain a bit because you want to see that lateral wall of that right ventricle and once you get a good view we're going to now put the emo tracing on it so hit the actions button and then hit the emo button and bring that emo cursor over to the lateral wall of that right ventricle. Now what we're seeing here is we're seeing just like two to three beats we want to see more of it so what you can do to change the sweep speed is just hit that fast button and now we've changed the sweep speed so we can see a lot more of that emo tracing. After we get a good emo tracing Holly is going to hit the freeze button and then calculate the excursion. The way that you do that is you select the measure button, hit the line tool and then select and it peek to a trough. So let's start off by placing it at the trough and then the second part of the line we're going to put it on the peak right there so we have a trough to peak and what's good about the butterfly app is that you just have to measure the slope and it will calculate the wide distance of that triangle for you and we see here a number of 2.04 for this patient's tapsee and that's how you use the butterfly to evaluate the patient's tapsee."

So we have a few different options. First, I am going to get a good apical for view on this patient. So here we've got our apical in view. I'm going to swipe left just a little bit to make it a tad darker. When I touch the screen, you see this icon with three little circles. Those are going to toggle between the different cardiac presets. Right now we're on the standard cardiac preset, which is good for your average cardiac scan. If we tap it once, it'll go over to cardiac coherence, which as you can see made the image a lot more black and white with a lot of contrast. This is good if you want to identify wall motion abnormalities. And then if you tap it one more time, it'll go over to cardiac deep, which is going to be good for your technically difficult patients. And those are the three cardiac presets available on the butterfly. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Automated Bladder Volume Calculation,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/usghrWxhRtylynLpWrgozg,Genitourinary,Automated Bladder Volume Calculation,Learn the steps to perform an automated bladder volume calculation using Butterfly.,Adwana Clayton,12/2/2022,I'm going to demonstrate how to obtain an automated bladder volume measurement using butterfly. The patient is laying flat and you can perform its exam from either the right or left side of the bed. First we're going to apply enough gel to the scanning surface of the butterfly to cover it. Next we're going to place the butterfly just above the pubic symphysis with the blue directional indicator dot facing towards the patient's right. As we slide up and down towards and away from the umbilicus the bladder will appear highlighted in blue as seen here. Next we will tilt the tail end to the cord end of the butterfly towards the head and away from the head until we obtain the largest volume of the bladder that we can see on the screen. Next we want to make sure that the box and the midline marker are aligned. We can slide left and right to make sure that the box within the bladder is lined up with the midline marker. Once we've achieved that press the calculate button and hold the probe still while an automated bladder volume is calculated. You can save that measurement and that's how you perform an automated bladder volume calculation using butterfly.

We are in the OB23 preset and I'm going to touch the actions button on the lower right side of the screen to choose fetal biometrics. I'll place the probe below where I already know the head is of the baby and I'm going to obtain an image where I can see the bright white circle of the skull all around the edge. I can see the folks to re-bry in the center of my screen and the thalamus. When I find the right image and plane of measurement, I'm going to hit freeze. Now I'm going to touch the measurement button on the lower right and choose HC for head circumference. Here we can first start by placing the little blue buttons around the edge of the bright white table of the skull and then we can use our other measurements to move this green circle to fit the ellipse around the edge of the skull. I have to make lots of micro adjustments, but our goal is to try to do a best fit with the green edge of this ellipse all the way around the bright white hypercoic edge of the skull. So here we can see the measurement at the bottom part of the screen gestational age 39 weeks one day. And remember, in the third trimester, this is plus minus three weeks. And that's how you use your butterfly to measure head circumference."

We're going to estimate gestational age using fetal biometrics. We are in the OB23 preset and under actions, I'm going to hit fetal biometrics, which appears at the bottom of the screen. I'm going to place my probe at home base where I know the fetal head is. I'm going to zoom out so I get a big picture. Then I'm going to scan from the fetal head up the baby's body. Here's the fetal heart, the fetal abdomen, the fetal stomach, fetal spine. Now this fluid-filled structure is the fetal bladder. I'll put that in the center of my screen and begin looking for the femur. Here we see the upper leg and cross section with the femur in the center, in cross section. I'll place it in the center of my screen and twist my probe to see a long axis view of that femur. Once I'm happy with my long axis view of the femur, here I'm just going to change my depth to get that image a little bit bigger. Once I'm happy with that view, I'm going to go ahead and hit freeze. Now I'm going to tap the measurement icon in the bottom of the screen and choose FL for femur length. I'm going to place my caliper at the edge of the femur on one side and then on the edge of the femur on the other side. Here we see the femur length measuring 37 weeks and two days.

In this view for fetal biometrics of the head I want to make sure I see the bright white outline of the skull all the way around, the bright white line of the folk cerebride down the center, and arthallomus. Once I've obtained this view I'm going to tap the measurement button AA and hit BPD by parietal diameter. I'll use this blue button to move my caliper towards the outer edge of the skull on one side across the folk cerebride in a perpendicular manner to the inner table of the skull on the inside. The bipytle diameter here is shown in centimeters and in weeks 35 weeks five days.

Ocular Exam,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/_3GwvEx9TY-NZKMP7ppAEQ,Ocular,Ocular Exam,An introduction to ocular ultrasound,Adwana Clayton,10/19/2022,"I'm going to show you how to perform an ocular examination using your butterfly. Now the first thing I like to do is actually to protect the eye. I don't like when gel gets inside the fissure and I like it to be easy to clean up afterwards. So what I do is I take a clear adhesive dressing. We unstick it here. You have your patient close their eyes, as you want to do this on a closed eyelid, and then gently put the adhesive part over the eye or on top of the eye. Now remember air block sound waves, so you want to kind of work it just like this to make sure that you can get to the eyelid right there without any big air bubbles in it. Now most of the time we definitely want to take the wrapping off of it. I actually keep the outer kind of plastic wrapping of it on because it makes it a lot easier to clean it up afterwards and we'll see when we're done. Now go ahead and grab your butterfly probe, make sure that you have the appropriate preset. So we're going to go down to the opto preset, the optomic preset. Good. Now we're going to put the gel over the eye. I'm very liberal with the amount of gel that I put on. The more gel, the better in my opinion. So I'm going to put a big dollop right over that eye. Right there. Now you don't want to apply too much pressure on the eyeball itself. So what you always want to do is brace. If you're looking on this left side, you can brace on the cheek here, put the probe there if you happen to be looking at the opposite eye on the bridge of the nose. So we're going to brace here and put our transducer gently over the eye and we can easily see the eye there. After you place the transducer on the eye, you can notice a few structures. Now we can see the circular globe of the eye and this is going to be mostly the posterior chamber right here. Right up there at the very top is the anterior chamber, which is separated from the posterior chamber by the iris. And if we fan just a little bit lower, we can actually see right there that little curve is actually the lens, which you're able to see. Now as far as depth goes, I like to have my depth usually around five centimeters or so. So I can see posterior to the globe as well. The important structures posterior to the globe are going to be this hypoacolic line that we see back there that is actually the optic nerve sheath. Now we can use that to calculate any abnormalities in the optic nerve sheath diameter. We can also use this view to look for any deformation of the normally circular globe to look for any retro bull bar hematomas. Now if we are looking specifically for the most common applications of ocular ultrasound, which is retinal detachments, vitrese attachments and vitrese hemiges, what I usually do is I decrease the depth so that I'm only looking at that globe. Right here. And then I'm going to increase my gain a little bit right there. And now we can focus on that globe right there. This hypoacolic appearance of the posterior chamber is normal. It's good. What we're looking for is any hyperacolic structures inside that posterior chamber. Now I'm fanning through in the transverse plane. I don't see anything back there now, but one thing that you can do to help out is have the patient look left and right to see if you see any motion of any bitches, hemorrhage, detachments that you might see in the back of the eye. So go ahead and look left and right. And I'm still seeing it nice and hypoacolic in that chamber. Thank you. And if you are not sure, it's always good to get two planes. This is in transverse. You can always turn the probe to the probe marker facing up and basically get the same exact view of that eye. And that is how you use your butterfly to perform in ocular examination. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Mitral Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (MAPSE),https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/d3ILu-6_TEGd6cRS4QifbQ,Cardiac,Mitral Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (MAPSE),Learn how to obtain a MAPSE calculation using the Butterfly,Adwana Clayton,10/19/2022,"This is how you obtain a mapsie or a mitral annular plane of systolic excursion. Make sure that you are in the appropriate preset by hitting that preset button and making sure that cardiac is selected. Now after that, Holly is going to get us a apical four chamber view. Now to get a good apical four chamber view, sometimes what you have to do is actually adjust the patient just a little bit to make sure that that tail is actually in the right place because the bed gets in the way if they're completely over onto their left side. After we get this apical four chamber view, we are going to calculate mapsie. So what we'll do is we'll hit the actions tab and hit the M mode button and place that M mode over the lateral border of that LV. And we can see here that we're actually seeing a great aim mode tracing right above. We're seeing a good excursion of that annulus around the mitral valve. Now you can actually change the sweep speed by hitting the slow button. If you hit it here, what we're seeing is we're seeing just a faster scroll, but for this, it's better to do the slow scroll, have the wider sweep speed there, and we're getting some good readings there. Now Holly is going to hit that freeze button for us. And now we're going to calculate that excursion. So what we're going to do is we're going to hit that measure button, select the line tool, and then measure basically the peak to the trough of that waveform of the annulus around the mitral valve. So you got to pick one line. It can be one line or the other. Holly is electing to choose just basically the top line and the bottom line there. And what you do is actually measure the slope. And this is actually a great function of the app here. You don't have to actually figure out what the Y axis is. You just measure the slope peak to the trough of one of those lines. And you can see that the Y axis is actually already calculated for you there. So it's measuring that excursion for you. We're seeing a number here of 1.39 centimeters for the mapsing. And that's how you use the butterfly to calculate the mapsie."
Prostate Volume,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/NkMI6RycQNqhMi7rsc_eCA,Genitourinary,Prostate Volume,This video demonstrates how to measure prostate volume using the Butterfly,Adwana Clayton,9/30/2022,I'm going to demonstrate how to take a prostate volume measurement using the butterfly. First we want to make sure that we're in our bladder preset so I'm going to tap the presets button and select bladder. Once my preset is activated I'm going to place a little bit of gel on my patient's abdomen down towards the pubic bone. I'm going to start with the indicator pointed towards my patient's right. This is going to give me a short axis view of my bladder which I'm going to use to help me find the prostate. With my probe on the patient's low abdomen I'm going to start to rock down towards the patient's feet in order to locate the bladder. We can see this anechoic structure. Here's the bladder. I'm going to go ahead and decrease my depth a bit to optimize my image. And just deep to the bladder we can see our short axis view of our prostate. It's kind of a rounded hypoacoeic structure. I'm going to sweep through the prostate in order to find the largest area. Once I found the widest dimension of my prostate in the short axis I'm going to use the actions tab to activate the manual volume calculation. We can see manual volume at the bottom of our screen which lets us know that we're ready to start taking volume measurements. Once I'm happy with my image I'm going to tap the freeze button and we'll see that our manual volume calculation menu is on the bottom of the screen. I'm going to use the measurement and annotation tab and I'm going to select diameter 1 which is going to give me a set of calipers. In order to take a width measurement I want to place my calipers at the widest portion of the prostate. And once I'm happy with that measurement I can tap confirm and that's going to add that to my calculations package. I'm going to go ahead and unfreeze and I'm going to go into the long axis. I'm going to rotate my probe indicator towards my patient's head. We can see our anechoic bladder and deep to the bladder we can now see the long axis of our prostate. I'm going to sweep from right to left to ensure that I find the largest dimension before I press freeze. I'm going to go ahead and tap on my text and measurement tab and I'm going to go ahead and select diameter 2 which is going to give us a set of calipers. I'm going to go ahead and measure my greatest dimension. I'm going to confirm and then to get our third measurement I'm going to tap one more time grab my third set of calipers and go ahead and measure in the anteroposterior dimension. Now that I've completed all three measurements we can see that a volume appears at the bottom of the screen. In this case it's 29.9. If I'm happy with that I can store an image and we've now completed our volume measurements. And this is how you measure prostate volume using the butterfly.

Great, let's get started. I'm going to go ahead and take a look for his spleen. So here we are in the left upper quadrant with my indicator towards the patient's left shoulder, slightly down towards the bed, and I'm just getting the long axis of the spleen in view. Once I'm happy with my image, I'm going to go ahead and phrase. Alright, and then if we press the annotations tab with the two A's, we can get a line measurement. And just by touching the edges of the line and dragging, Janet's able to get a measurement of the spleen. In this case, we've got a measurement of about 12 centimeters that shows up at the bottom. And then if we wanted to add a label to this? Yeah, let's do that. I'm going to go back to this annotations menu and select the label button. As you can see here, we get a nice keyboard that comes up as well as some suggestions at the top. I'm going to scroll over here because I happen to know that we have the annotation we want, spleen, done. And then if I wanted to get fancy, I could drag it to whatever portion of the image I want to put it on. Fantastic. And then if we hit the camera, we've now saved the image to the image reel with a measurement and a label. that's how you do labeling and measuring with butterfly. [BLANK_AUDIO]"

Now I like to do that by double tapping on the screen, so in this case we have the radius down here in the bottom left of the image, this hypericolic curve structure, and if I double tap on it, I can zoom in and get a closer look. On the top right you can see the thumbnail that shows where I'm zoomed on the image overall. To exit out I'll simply double tap again and keep in mind that you can double tap anywhere on the image to zoom on that particular part of the image. Now if you have a tablet or phone that's mounted, you may also want to pinch to zoom, so I'm going to tick my probe off and you can see that you can get fine control doing the same pinching motion as you get with double tap, but when I'm holding a phone and scanning I like to double tap to zoom."

First I'm just going to go ahead and remove the Saran wrap. And go ahead and remove the sleeve. We'll lift the top on the box. And here we have the IQ Plus itself and we'll lift that out and put it aside for the moment. We've got a getting started card that walks you through the initial steps you need to download the app, how to log into it and connect your butterfly IQ Plus to your mobile device and start scanning. A couple of stickers. We've got a tray in here with a charging pad and a USB cable to hook up to power, a charging adapter and several charging power supplies that will fit multiple power outlets. And that's what's in the box. We'll go ahead and put this aside. When you first unbox the IQ Plus it may come with a charge. You can press the button on the IQ Plus itself and in this case there's no charge. Regardless it's a good idea to charge it up first to get a full charge before you start scanning. I'm now going to remove the IQ Plus and the butterfly logo should align in the same direction as the butterfly logo on the IQ Plus for charging. And we'll go ahead and place that in the charging cradle. At which point it will start to glow blue as it's charging to let us know that charging is in progress. As we can see here we have one of the four indicator lights that's blinking indicating that the IQ Plus is starting to charge. When all four lights are illuminated we know that the IQ Plus is fully charged and ready to scan. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Kidneys,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/05z2XXIRT_e3YxyzUurPTw,Renal,Kidneys,This video demonstrates imaging of the kidneys using the Butterfly,Adwana Clayton,9/30/2022,"Let's take a quick look at the urinary tract for obstruction. The first thing I'm going to do is select the appropriate preset, which would be abdomen in this case. Select some gel on the probe. I'm going to start with the right kidney. With the indicator towards the patient's head, I'm going to place the butterfly on the flank. Here we see the inferior margin of the liver. I'm going to just angle my transducer posteriorly to come into the area of the kidney. You may find as you scan that the indicator actually ends up being slightly closer to the bed than the inferior portion of the transducer. This is very normal because the kidneys lie with the superior pull, slightly posterior, and the inferior pull, slightly anterior. Here we can see a nice sagittal view of the right kidney. Once we get that centered in our screen, I'm going to go ahead and fan out laterally until I don't see the kidney anymore, and then go ahead and fan medially. I'm going to take a second here and focus in on the collecting system. You can see some hypoacolic areas there within the collecting system area, but I want to see if that is actually collecting system or if that's vessel. In order to differentiate, I go to actions, put on color Doppler, and you can see that those areas fill with color. This filling indicates that they're vessels and not the collecting system. Now turning color off, I'm going to take my transducer with the indicator towards the patient's right, which on the side translates to towards the bed. We're going to look at the transverse images of the kidney. Once it's centered in my screen, I'm fanning up superiorly through the upper pull, and then slowly fanning inferiorly through the lower pull. Then coming back to the area where the kidney looks like a C to evaluate the collecting system. You can also put color on in this plane if you'd like, although right now it's not necessary. Transducer done with the right kidney can move on to the left. Little more gel on the transducer. Indicator towards the patient's head. And once I have this in view, you can really appreciate the fact that the transducer is at a slight angle with that indicator slightly closer to the bed. Again I'm going to fan laterally all the way through, then medially all the way through. Once again you can put color on to take a look at vessels. Now turning the transducer into the transverse plane with the indicator towards the patient's right which now translates towards the ceiling. Up through the upper pull, and then fanning down through the lower pull. Taking one more second to come back towards the collecting system. So here we're going to have a backward C. Okay now we go down and take a look at the bladder. Little more gel. I like to start looking at the bladder in the transverse plane, so the indicator will be towards me towards the patient's right hand side. It's very common as you see here when you put down the transducer, not to see the bladder. The majority of the time when this is the case, you're just not low enough. You really need to be down almost to the pubic symphysis. So here is his bladder and as you can see there's not a whole lot in it. I'm going to go ahead and decrease my depth so that we get a better view. And decrease my gain. What we're interested in here is looking at that posterior wall of the bladder to make sure that there are no stones sitting inside. We also want to look posterior to the bladder itself to make sure that there's no dilatation of the yerters. Once we're happy in this plane, we can turn the transducer 90 degrees indicator towards the head, again angling down into the pelvis and centering the bladder on the screen. Once it's centered, we can fan out patients right and then back towards the left. And this is how we evaluate the kidneys and the bladder for collecting system dilatation and also stones.

Aorta Protocol,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/ho4y4EwLSwiSbxQLwlZEig,Aorta,Aorta Protocol,This video demonstrates how to image the aorta using the aorta protocol,Adwana Clayton,9/30/2022,"So we're going to demonstrate how to do a focused abdominal aorta scan looking for aortic aneurysm using the aorta protocol tool. I find that the tool keeps me honest in terms of making sure I'm documenting and labeling the images as I'm saving them and helps me move through that workflow faster. Okay, in order to get started, let's hit presets and select the aorta and gallbladder preset. Next, I'm going to go to the Actions tab and activate the aorta protocol. And this is a great reminder of what images we want to include in our exam. So there's a proximal mid and distal measurement at the bifurcation, just proximal to the bifurcation, and then a longitudinal measurement. So let's go ahead and start proximally transverse, which is how we usually begin the exam. Great. With my indicator towards the patient's right hand side, I'm placing the transducer just below the xiphoid process. I like to try to use the left lobe of the liver as a window if possible. And here you can see just deep to the liver tissue that hypoacolic circle and a coic circle pulsating, which is the aorta. Sitting right on top of the hyperacolic line, which is the vertebral body, which is a good landmark for the abdominal aorta. So we'll go ahead and freeze there. And then using the annotations tool, we'll put some calipers on and get a measurement of the outer wall to outer wall. Typically, these measurements are going to be near field to far field or anterior posterior. We're looking for a measurement under three centimeters, which we're well under here. So we'll save that. And then as we exit out of that view by unfreezing, we're brought back to the protocol. We can go ahead and select our next view. And we can see that we're automatically labeled for the next view. So no need to go into label the images. As you step through, it's going to just automatically take you to the next view in the sequence. As we come down into the mid portion here, the aorta course is a little bit more anteriorly, so I'm going to decrease my depth. OK. We're freezing the image. And while Janet's obtaining that measurement, really important to note how much compression she has on the abdomen and how moving bowel gas out of the way is the byproduct of that degree of pressure. So sometimes I'll actually have both hands on the transducer because you need to put so much pressure on. And the patient's tolerated tremendously well. I just warn them in advance. If it's uncomfortable, let me know. We can ease up. But getting some of that bowel gas out of the way will actually bring the butterfly closer to the aorta and will let you get a better image. And certainly, gas gets in the way of a good old shot image, so we do want to try and displace that. So as we're working down towards the bifurcation, there we are at the distal aorta, and then we've got the lumbar spine just below. We'll go ahead and obtain a measurement there as well. Out or wall to outer wall, still well within the range of normal. And you'll see these measurements get smaller as you go down. A normal abdominal aorta will taper as it gets more distal, so that's normal. And then we'll go ahead into a longitudinal view. So the indicator up towards the patient's head, we bring the butterfly back to the zifeway process because we're looking for a proximal measurement. When we do a longitudinal measurement, we want to make sure we're not looking at the vena cava. So we'll fan towards the patient's right, and here we can see the inferior vena cava just below the liver. And then as we fan towards the patient's left, that structure deeper to the liver there is the proximal abdominal aorta. And we'll freeze there. We'll get another measurement perpendicular to the axis of the aorta to make sure it's a true perpendicular measurement. And we'll save that image. And once we save that image and unfreeze, if we exit the protocol, it's going to ask if we want to exit, we're going to confirm that we do. And those images are going to be automatically labeled in your exam reel. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
eFAST,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/YqlVPldnQbm-IOqPus4rnA,FAST,eFAST,This video demonstrates the eFAST exam,Adwana Clayton,9/30/2022,"So, the E-Fast or extended fast exam allows us to evaluate trauma patients for the presence of pneumothorax, hemoparacardium, or hemoparitineum. I'm going to demonstrate how to do an E-Fast exam using the E-Fast protocol. So first we'll go into presets and we'll select the fast preset. And then we'll go into the actions tab and select the E-Fast protocol. Now you don't have to use every window in this protocol, but if you're doing a full E-Fast exam, you may choose to use all. I'm going to show you that this auto labels your images. So this keeps me honest, helps me document my studies appropriately and make sure I'm labeling all of my views. You can sequence your E-Fast any way you want. I'm going to start with the lung in this case. So we'll click on RL for right lung. We can see it's labeled right lung already. And I'm going to place the butterfly on the right anterior chest with the indicator towards the patient's head. Now because we're looking for lung sliding, I'm going to decrease the depth so we can look at the pleural line and decrease the gain a bit. And once I'm happy that I'm seeing sliding at the pleural line, I'm going to hit the camera button to record. When I hit stop, I'm now brought back to the home screen of the E-Fast protocol. I'm going to select the left lung and auto labels the image for me. And now I can take a look at the left lung, note that they're sliding. Go ahead and save a clip. And brought back to the home screen. We'll move on to the cardiac portion of the exam. And I'll do a peristonal long axis view. And placing the butterfly just to the left of the sternum, increasing my depth a bit, adjusting my gain. I can determine that there's no hemopericardium. Save a clip for documentation. And then move on to a subcostal view. Basically clinically, either a subcostal or a peristonal long is sufficient for evaluation for hemopericardium. In this case, I'll demonstrate both. So let's have you take a deep breath in. And we can see the subcostal view of the heart there. I'm going to save a clip. And now we're ready to move on to the abdominal portion of the E-Fast exam. So we'll start off in the right upper quadrant. I'm going to click R-U-Q. We're auto-labeled. And then I'm going to place the butterfly around the level of the Zifeway process in the right mid-axillary line with the indicator towards the head. Here I've got liver. And if I fan down towards the bed, I've got the hepatorhenyl interface or Marson's pouch. I can see that there's no fluid above the diaphragm, so no hemothorax. And I can take a look while recording a clip, fanning all the way through the interface and catching the inferior pull of the right kidney, as well as the inferior lobe of the liver. I'm going to stop there. And next, I'll be moving on to the left upper quadrant. I'm going to select L-U-Q. I'm going to place the probe in the left upper quadrant with the indicator towards the head in the posterior axillary line. And I'll often rotate the probe slightly to improve my window. And here I can see above the diaphragm there's no fluid. I can see the diaphragm and the spleen, the interface of the spleen and diaphragm, there's no fluid there. Splendorhenyl interface and the inferior pull of the spleen. And now we'll move on to the last window, which is the pelvic window. I'm going to select pelvis. Place the butterfly with the indicator towards the patient's head. I like to do a sagittal view of the pelvis and just above the pubic symphysis. And then you'll need to rock the probe into the pelvis so you're over the brim of the pelvis to get a view of the bladder. From here you can adjust depth and gain as desired, save a clip and fan through the bladder left and right to make sure that there's no fluid deep to the bladder. When you're done, you'll be brought back to the home screen again. I can simply exit the protocol, confirm that I want to exit and my images are stored and documented in the exam reel and ready for storage. And that's how you perform an E-Fast protocol with the E-Fast protocol tool. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT),https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/eloENTSWSiGQ_rLHFrY_JQ,DVT,Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT),This video is an introduction to using the Butterfly to evaluate for deep vein thrombosis,Adwana Clayton,9/30/2022,"So in patients where we suspect there might be a deep venous thrombosis or DVT, we're going to want to do a focused lower extremity venous ultrasound. And we're going to go through that exam right now. I think the most important thing for me when I do this exam is to make sure there's enough gel because you're going to start all the way at the England Olegament and go down past the knee. And for that reason, I will just take gel, apply it where I think I'm going to place the probe, and apply a bunch of gel down the leg so I can not have to continually regel over the course of the exam. I do the same thing. All right, so getting started here, let's go to the presets. I'm going to go down to the vascular deep vein preset and select that. With my indicator towards the patient's right hand side, we're going to place the butterfly up and into the inguinal crease. And I'm looking for an area where I only see two vessels. And that's a great mark that you've started high enough up because the common femoral artery is going to bifurcate into the deep and the superficial. The common femoral vein is going to bifurcate into the femoral vein and the deep femoral vein. And if you're just seeing two vessels here, common femoral artery, common femoral vein, you know that you're high enough in the leg that you're not missing approximate dbt. Absolutely. So I want to make sure that I am above the level of the greater saphenous vein. And that's another indicator that you're high enough. Okay. And so once I'm here, I'm going to just apply some pressure. All right. We can see that we're completely collapsing the common femoral vein here. Generally, you want to apply enough pressure to completely co-app the walls or collapse the walls of the vein. The mark of a dbt or a deep venous thrombosis is that you're not going to be able to compress because there's thrombus in the vein. And then the artery will sometimes deform to some degree. So if we compress, we can see a little bit of collapse of the artery, but you shouldn't be collapsing the artery completely. Okay. So once I'm happy with this level, I'm going to start walking down the leg just slightly. So here I'm coming just a little bit more distal. And I see the area where the greater saphenous vein is coming into the view as well as the deep femoral vein. Again, with a compression, making sure that the area as the greater saphenous vein comes into the common femoral, that we're clear of any sort of blockage, and continuing down, watching the vessel open and close with pressure. Make sure that you release that pressure in between and allow the vessel to refill. And Janet, you just increased your depth there, which is something you'll need to do as you do this scan. The common femoral vein and common femoral artery, very close to the skin surface at the iliac crest, or the iliac, in little crease, excuse me, as you start to go down the leg, they dive deeper into the thigh, and then ultimately all the way to the back portion of the leg as they're in the papatio fossa. So it's normal to need to increase your depth a bit as you go. We're just compressing every centimeter or two on the way down and just demonstrating that that femoral vein collapses completely with compression. Once you get to the area here of the distal femoral vein, you may need to free up your hand here, because in order to get the collapsibility of the vessel, you may have to compress from the contralateral side. I'm going to increase my depth a little bit more. So here we've got femoral vein and femoral artery on top, and as we apply pressure from the contralateral side, we can see that that femoral vein is collapsing completely. And that's just a lot of tissue to compress through. The adductor canal is kind of stiff on the medial aspect of the leg, so getting that two hand compression is really valuable here. Great. So once we're done there, we can wrap our transducer around and sort of bend just slightly into a frog leg position. And this will allow us to see the papatio vein a bit more better, increase my gain. So there are times needed to do that in the papatio fossa. And worth calling out here that higher up in the papatio fossa, when you first start your exam, the papatio vein is going to be superficial to the papatio artery. So as opposed to the femoral vein being deep to the femoral artery, you're now looking from the other side of the leg. So don't be surprised when the collapsible structure is superficial to the arterial structure. Getting rid of some of that depth here. And again, just walking down every centimeter or so, applying some pressure. And following that vessel down until it trifurcates. This is just a great example of how this is really a compression B-mode exam. You don't need to use color. You don't need to use pulse wave doppler. It's a very straightforward exam. Identify the vessel, make sure you're high enough, and just sequentially compress all the way down until you've gotten through the trifurcation. If you're really concerned about a DVT, you may want to refer the patient for a comprehensive exam where it's all the way down to the ankle. You may want to consider ancillary blood testing like a D-dimer. You may want to bring the patient back in five to seven days for another exam if the proximal exam looks clean. But that's a really nice example of how you walk through a focused lower extremity of venous ultrasound for DVT. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Scanning Basics,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/hvrLE9rmQCOBwBof1yap0g,Intro,Scanning Basics,This video is an introduction to the basic features of the Butterfly,Adwana Clayton,9/30/2022,"So if you're just getting familiar with butterfly, here's a review of some basic core ultrasound scanning principles, as well as an introduction to some of the functionality of the device in the app itself. So we'll start off with just choosing the right preset for the right exam. So I'm going to scan myself. I'm going to scan my anterior neck and my carotid artery. So feel free to follow along or just use this as a reference to get oriented. But because we have an ultrasound on a chip that images the entire body, you need to make sure that you have the preset chosen for the right part of the body you're looking at. Because if you're trying to use, say, a cardiac preset to look at the neck, it's not going to look very good. So we're going to hit the preset button. We're going to go down to vascular carotid and hit select. Okay. Now we're going to go ahead and apply some gel. And there's no right amount of gel, but you want to have enough gel so that you've got good probe contact. So that should do it. I do want to point out the blue directional indicator, the blue dot on the butterfly. This corresponds to the blue dot on the screen. So that just tells you which direction is which. If it's facing to my left, on the screen it's going to be facing to my left. So that helps you stay oriented. And then let's just talk a little bit about how to hold the butterfly itself. So sometimes new users are a little bit scared or intimidated by ultrasound and they'll hold it all the way at the tail end like that, kind of like a dirty sock. Or they'll grab it like a club. What you really want to do is hold it so you can get fine control over movements of the butterfly. So that's going to be down towards the base where the scanning surface or footprint is. It leaves your ring and pinky finger free to brace on the skin so you don't slide by accident because gel is slippery. And it gives you fine motor control. Think about it. You hold a scalpel if you're a surgeon or you hold a pan or a pencil the same way in your hand. So that's the basics. We're going to go ahead and apply it to my neck. I've got the directional indicator to my right. And let's say this is the image we get and we're looking for the carotid artery which is here. One of the core things you want to do besides holding the butterfly appropriately and being in the right preset is center the structure of image from left to right. So I'm going to go ahead and slide to my left and I'm going to bring the carotid right into the center of the screen which lets me evaluate it best as opposed to having it over on the side of the screen. If you can't remember which way you're oriented it's okay just to slide back and forth to get your bearings. You're not going to be causing any damage with ultrasound so feel free to look around. And then we'll go ahead and we'll center there. And then the last thing I want to talk about in the very basics is just pressure. Pressure is different from compression. Compression is something we do to kind of move structures out of the way like bowel gas. But pressure is just how much pressure do you hold on the probe when you do any scan. And new users in particular will be afraid to press too hard because they're worried appropriately about causing discomfort for their patients. But people tolerate quite a bit of pressure with ultrasound and what it does when you apply more pressure is it brings the structure of interest closer to the top of the screen and gets you a better look at it. So here the carotid is around two centimeters we can see on the depth there. And if I just apply some pressure as I'm scanning I can bring it up to about 1.5 and get a clearer image of the carotid artery. Those are some basic principles to get you started. Alright now that we've gotten an image of the carotid here let's talk about some core features within the app that we can use to make sure that we're getting a good look at the structure of interest. So there's a lot of functionality built into the app. We're not going to cover all of it by any means. We're going to cover what you really need to know for 90-95% of your scans just to get an image optimized and looking good. And that's going to be preset which we already covered depth so to adjust depth you're going to slide up or down on the screen. If we swipe down here we've got two centimeters of depth you can see the carotid is cut off at the bottom of the screen so that's insufficient depth. If we swipe up we can get all the way down to six centimeters but now the carotid is tiny and up in the top portion of the screen in the top half. That means everything deep to that down here isn't providing us any information and is wasted space. So we want to swipe until we get the right depth where the structure is centered from top to bottom just like we centered it from left to right. Next is gain. We want to adjust gain by swiping right or left. If we go too far to the right we start seeing everything gets kind of washed out and we see echoes in the artery and that's not a really useful image. If we swipe all the way to the left and I just adjusted my depth by accident there. We swipe all the way to the left we've got a dark image where you can't really see anything. So somewhere in the middle gets you again where the artery looks anechoic or black. We can see the muscle. We can see skin and soft tissue above and this is a good gain setting here for us to get a nice image. The snowflake button here will freeze the image and we can press the camera button to save a still image. We'll see it show up in the exam reel. And then if we unfreeze we can also save a video clip by pressing the camera button and that goes up to a minute but typically you know four to ten seconds is plenty unless you have an institutional guideline for a specific clip length in which case we advise that you follow that. So we're going to cover some basic maneuvers with the butterfly so that when we say things like rotate or slide or fan or tilt you know what we're talking about. So sliding we keep the footprint or the scanning surface still and we just move the entire assembly. We move the entire butterfly in one direction or another. In this case we're sliding head to toe but we already were doing sliding when we did left and right to center the carotte earlier. Rotating we're going to take the directional indicator and just twist the probe to turn the probe so now it's facing up towards my head and now we've got a long view of the carotte artery running left and right across the screen. So that's rotation. We'll rotate back to a short view. We'll demonstrate tilting or fanning which is keeping the footprint of the probe still and moving the cord end so that we're just tilting the probe in and out of the imaging plane. This is a really useful technique for sweeping through the kidney looking for hydroenterphrosis or sweeping through the gallbladder looking for gallstones so you don't have to actually slide through. You can just kind of point the beam where you want to look and that's fanning. And then rocking is the last one where we're going to be basically doing the same thing. We're tilting the butterfly but we're tilting it within the imaging plane. So if we want to look a little bit more immediately we look by tilting and then we can rock out more laterally. So this lets us rock left and right as opposed to fanning in and out of the plane, sliding and rotating and those are some of the core manipulation movements that you'll do with butterfly.

So we're going to demonstrate how to do that with butterfly. Okay, we are in the OB1GYN preset, placing the butterfly on the skin and locating the gestational sac. Alright, and we've got gestational sac in the center of the screen. We can see yolk sac on the right, fetal pole in the center. And I'm just fanning through here to locate the motion of the heart. And double tapping there just to zoom in and we can see fetal heart motion right in the center of the screen. So from there we'll use M mode by going to the actions tab and activating M mode. And we can reposition the M mode cursor or spike as needed to intersect the fetal heart motion. And then we're seeing periodic repetitive signal on the screen representing fetal heart motion over time. Phrasing this image, I can then go to my measurements, select the calipers, and measure one cycle. And we have our heart rate displayed on the screen automatically. And that's how you measure fetal heart rate using butterfly. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Crown Rump Length (CRL),https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/K8S38zY-RB2bakPAirPzDQ,OB/GYN,Crown Rump Length (CRL),This video demonstrates how to measure crown rump length using the Butterfly,Adwana Clayton,9/30/2022,"So in the first trimester of pregnancy we really use crown rump length to estimate gestational age and we're going to show you how to use crown rump length on the butterfly. Great. You're going to start in the OB1 GYN preset and I'm going to go ahead and place the butterfly on the patient. Transverse or sagittal is not so important. We really want to identify the lie of the fetus. And what we're working on doing here is getting really the longest view of the fetus from the crown to the rump so we can measure. We've got the yolk sac over on the right side of the screen which we won't include in our measurement and we can see fetal heart rate there in the center of the fetal pole and then I'm going to go ahead and select from the actions tab the crown rump length. Freeze my image and activate my caliper. And here we're just going one end of the fetal pole to the other end of the fetal pole and we'll see an automatic calculation at the bottom of the screen. In this case eight weeks three days we can go ahead and confirm that and then if we wanted to if you press the annotations tool for us Janet you can see that there's CRL2, CRL3 so if we wanted to get multiple measurements and get an average you're able to do that as well and that's how you measure crown rump length using butterfly."
Applying a Sterile Cover,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/4cfWo00jQ_eY-6IbFAB7Vw,Intro,Applying a Sterile Cover,This video demonstrates how to apply a sterile cover to the Butterfly,Adwana Clayton,9/30/2022,"I'm going to show you how to place a sterile transducer cover on the butterfly. First, we are going to open our transducer cover. We have our sterile ultrasound gel, our cover, some stickers, and the rubber bands. We have already placed ultrasound gel on the transducer. The gel on the inside of the sterile sheath does not need to be sterile. So we just use bottle gel for that, and I have sterile gloves on. Next, we are going to open up our transducer cover. We are going to place our hand inside and grab the head of the probe. Edwan is not going to let go until I get a good grip. Okay, I'm good. Now we are going to slide the sheath all the way down. I notice we have a couple of bubbles on the inside of that, which is okay. We have our sterile gloves on, so we are going to just smooth out the surface there and make sure that we don't have any bubbles on there. Then we are going to take one rubber band and slide it around the neck of that transducer, making sure that we have no bubbles on the inside. We have successfully placed our transducer cover.

Female Pelvis,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/yKC38linQm2iDRL5PmLQFg,OB/GYN,Female Pelvis,This video demonstrates the technique of surveying the female pelvis using the Butterfly,Adwana Clayton,9/30/2022,"I'm going to show you how to scan the female pelvis using the butterfly. I'm going to start with my probe in the sagittal orientation with my probe marker toward the patient's head. And I'm going to use the bladder as a window to visualize the uterus and the long axis. So here we see bladder at the top, that dark anechoic area, and then just posterior to that we see the long uterus. Here I want a fan from left to right to scan all the way through the uterus. So I'm going to fan over to the patient's right. I'm going to start to see her ovary pop into view there. Then I'm going to go back and scan through to the patient's left. And I'm using that fanning or tailing maneuver to do that. So once I've scanned all the way through this, in this view the long axis on the uterus, you can also see the endometrium lining really well. So this is a great view if you wanted to measure that. You can also focus more in fearly to the patient's cervix. And once you've gotten all of those in view, I'm going to turn my probe to the transverse view. And then fan up to the patient's fundus. And then just do a sweep from fundus to cervix. Scanning down. Once we've done that, I'm going to look for the patient's ovaries, which I've already seen pop out really nicely, by scanning through each adenexa. So while staying in the transverse view, I'm going to start in the patient's right and just fan superior to inferior through her adenexa to find those ovaries. We passed one, and we go back to that. So while we're looking at the patient's right ovary here, we see an anechoic area which is just a cyst. And this is something that we can commonly see as we're scanning the ovaries. If you wanted to see the ovary in the long axis as well, you just keep your probe exactly where it's at. Rotate it 90 degrees, and then you get that second long plane for the ovary. Now to search for her left ovary, I'm going to go back to my transverse axis. And then using the bladder as a window, sometimes it's even helpful if I kind of slide my probe over to the contralateral side and scan through the bladder to visualize the left adenexa looking for the ovary. And we can see hers really nicely right here. You can see a couple follicles on it. That's what makes it stand out in the adenexa. And then I'm just going to turn my probe 90 degrees again to visualize that in the opposite plane. From here we've seen both ovaries. We've looked at the uterus, so I'm just going to fan back into the long axis. And then in this view of the long uterus, we can actually identify some darker hypo-coach fluid just posterior to the uterus. Free fluid can also be a very common finding in the female pelvis. And that's how we scan a female pelvis with the butterfly. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Ovary Scanning,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/kXhuF5_rQOOoB1SEkEJipw,OB/GYN,Ovary Scanning,This video demonstrates the technique of identifying and imaging the ovaries using the Butterfly,Adwana Clayton,9/30/2022,"So now I'm going to show you how to assess the ovary. I am on the OB1 GYM preset and I'm in the transverse plane on the patient's pelvis. I like to use the bladder as a window to search for the ovaries. It really helps identify them. So right now I see her right ovary. We can see that there's a cyst on it. So I'm going to decrease my depth, scan through that ovary. I'm going to look at it in the longitudinal plane as well. So I'm going to rotate my transducer about 90 degrees. And I'm able to see the full length of the ovary. So here I'm going to freeze. I like to get a measurement. I'm going to go into my caliper tool, select my line. I'm going to get a long axis of the full ovary itself. And then we'll go in and get a second line for the opposite measurement. I'm going to capture that image by hitting the camera and then unfreeze. Now I'd like to measure that cyst and then we'll go in and get both of the transverse measurements as well. So freeze line. I'm going to get about 2.3 centimeters in the longest view for that cyst. Capture that. Unfreeze. Then I'm going to look at both the ovary and the cyst and the transverse view. Again using the bladder as a good window. I'm going to freeze. I'm going to measure the ovarian borders first. Then we'll get the third measurement on that cyst. Line. We've got our third measurement so now I'm going to capture. Then another thing I'd like to do on this cyst is to put color doppler over it to see if there's any peripheral blood flow. I'm going to go into my color flow which is under the actions tab. And then move the box right over the ovary. We can see that there's blood flow getting to the ovarian tissue here and then we can see that there's no blood flow within that anechoic cyst. Then if you were having a hard time picking up blood flow with color doppler we also have a power doppler which is similar but it's more sensitivity. So this isn't going to give you directional flow but it's going to give you presence of flow. We can see clearly some vascularity right around the periphery of that cyst. I'm going to freeze and capture. Once we have done our measurements and we've put color doppler on it that is how you assess an ovary using the butterfly. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Small Bowel Obstruction,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/A0rME5mhQbqXB2gSqhB_UQ,Gastrointestinal,Small Bowel Obstruction,This video demonstrates the technique of using the Butterfly to evaluate for small bowel obstruction,Adwana Clayton,9/30/2022,"I'm going to show you how to evaluate your patient for the presence or absence of a small bowel obstruction. Make sure that you place your butterfly on the appropriate setting by hitting your presets tab and selecting abdomen. And as far as pro placement, it's important to understand that when patients have bowel obstructions, they might have partial small bowel obstructions and still have a good amount of air in the lumen of their bowel. There goes more anterior and if you start with the transducer on the anterior abdominal wall, that air that is in the lumen of that bowel might block your sound waves from getting to the lumen, which would make it so that you can't see the lumen. So I'm going to start off by placing the transducer on the lateral aspect. I am going to palpate the anterior supiri, euliac spine right around there. And I'm going to place my transducer right above that, right cephalat to that with my probe beam facing more anterior. And in this specific patient, I'm seeing abdominal wall here. That's the peritoneum. And I'm seeing the lumpy bumpy appearance of gas in bowel, which is a normal appearance. So I'm going to fan through here. I'm going to move up cephalat and make sure that I'm just moving that transducer all around to look for the presence of any dilated loops of bowel. Now, once I've evaluated that area, I'm going to then do the exact same thing on the other side. And I'm seeing abdominal wall. I'm seeing the peritoneal lining and I'm seeing the lumpy bumpy appearance of bowel gas. And then I'm going up here. I'm seeing a bit of the liver. So that means I'm a little too high. I'm going to go back in the cod ad direction, fanning up and down. And all I'm seeing is normal bowel. What you're looking for here is you're looking for dilated loops of bowel greater than 2.5 centimeters in diameter with two and fro movement back and forth of the content within the lumen of that bowel. Now, I've done the lateral aspects of her abdomen. If I don't see anything there, at that point, what I'll do is I'll go ahead and look at the anterior abdominal wall. I'll start off usually in the left lower quadrant right here. And I will just bring my transducer and evaluate the entire anterior abdominal area by bringing that transducer, sliding it up, moving over and going back down. Always looking for those dilated loops of bowel, which we are not seeing here. Make sure that you're about the entire abdomen until you get to the lateral aspect over here. And fortunately, we don't see any dilated loops of bowel here. And that's how you use the butterfly to evaluate your patient for the presence or absence of a small bowel obstruction. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Probe Maneuvers,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/HT0X9hxfTrOUS5va20_nUA,Intro,Probe Maneuvers,This video demonstrates basic probe maneuvers that can be used during any type of ultrasound exam,Adwana Clayton,9/30/2022,"So no matter what ultrasound application you're scanning, some common terminology for probe maneuvers is good to understand. So here I have a long IVC in view and if I want to confirm that this is the IVC, I can do what's called fanning or tailing, where I take my tail of the transducer and I just go left to right and see the aorta, see the IVC. You can use rotating when you want to go from a long axis to a transverse axis. So I'm going to take the orientation marker, which is the blue dot on the probe and I'm going to rotate that counter clockwise to the patient's right. And then from here you can also do a maneuver called rocking, which is just rocking side to side. And then if you wanted to slide up in superior and inferior on IVC, which is slide distally. And those are some ultrasound maneuvers that will help optimize your image using butterfly. >> Okay."
Applying an adhesive dressing as a sterile cover,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/QeX47l1TTzCA59-SntKrxw,Intro,Applying an adhesive dressing as a sterile cover,How to apply a sterile adhesive dressing to the face of the Butterfly.,Adwana Clayton,9/29/2022,"I'm going to show you how to place an adhesive clear dressing on your butterfly. When you're opening up your adhesive dressing package be really careful to not touch the non-stick side because in this case that's actually the part that you want to keep clean. The next step is removing the backing from it and you're going to grab your butterfly device and we're going to just put it just on one side making sure that we have good purchase here of that adhesive. We're going to leave this side right here open and we're going to put a thin layer of gel on the inside of that right here. Notice that I'm placing that thin layer of gel on the adhesive side and the reason for that is when I bring the dressing all the way over you see how I'm actually bringing that gel with me all the way across. Now you do want to do your best to make sure that there's not a whole lot of bubbles on the surface of the adhesive dressing. However notice that we're seeing some bubbles here. Don't wipe them out like we do with our sterile probe covers, our big ones because if we touch the surface of that with our non-sterile gloves we've now made the surface of that not clean and then what's the point of putting the dressing on there. After we're done with that what we're going to do is we are going to take off our paper border here. We're going to smooth down the edges here. Now we have our thin adhesive dressing placed on our transducer and we are ready to perform our procedure and that's how you place an adhesive clear dressing on your butterfly."
Testicular Ultrasound,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/MqA2dDDySRCXwRA0EheQGg,Small Organ,Testicular Ultrasound,Learn set up and scanning techniques for testicular ultrasound,Adwana Clayton,8/18/2022,"I'm going to demonstrate how to perform testicular ultrasound using the butterfly. The first thing we need to do when performing testicular ultrasound is get our patient position properly. I'm going to keep a couple towels for this exam. The first one I'm going to use for the patient to be able to tuck their penis towards their abdomen. And we're going to use this towel to help keep things in place. It's often time helpful to have your patients put their hands at their sides on this towel to help keep things in position. The second towel we're going to make a roll and we're going to place this beneath the scrotum to help stabilize the anatomy that we're about to image. Once our patient is prepared, I'm going to go ahead and select the correct preset, which in this case is small organ. Once my preset is activated, I'm going to apply some gel to the scrotum. And I'm going to take my butterfly with the indicator pointed towards my patient's right and place it midline on the scrotum. I'm going to increase my gain. And the very first image we want to acquire is an image at midline that demonstrates both testicles in the same imaging field. If I move to the patient's right, this allows us to isolate the right testicle. And if I move to the patient's left, it allows us to isolate the left testicle. And this is how we perform testicular imaging with the butterfly. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Testicular Torsion,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/Ri9H9oa_TTauN37I29evtg,Small Organ,Testicular Torsion,Use of color doppler in testicular torsion,Adwana Clayton,8/18/2022,"This video demonstrates the appearance of a testicular torsion. We are in a small organ preset, and in this video the indicator is pointed towards the patient's head, as this is a long view of the testicle. The first thing that we see is that we don't see any color flow within our angled color box which is placed over the testicle. We see that our scale is set low at 10, and typically in a healthy testicle we would see small testicular vessels lighting up within the color box at this low color setting. The other thing that we notice is there is a rim of anechoic fluid seen around the testicle. This represents a small hydrocial which is also quite common in cases of testicular torsion. To definitively diagnose this as a torsion, we can use the bilateral testicular image where we get both testicles in the transverse plane side by side and place the color box over both testicles. In this image the healthy testicles should light up with color while the tors testicle will not."

We are in a small organ preset and the indicator is pointed towards the patient's head. The epiditimous lies soparolateral to the testicle. And once we locate it, we want to make sure that we image the epiditimous all the way from head to tail to rule out any abnormalities. Here we can see at the beginning of the video, we start at the epiditimal head, which is a little bit plumper than the epiditimal body, which we see here. We can continue along and follow it all the way down to the epiditimal tail, which is what we want to do to ensure that we don't see any abnormalities all the way along the structure."

We're in a small organ preset and the indicator is pointed towards the patient's right. When performing a testicular exam, we want to make sure that we sweep through both testicles in their entirety in both planes. This video demonstrates the process of serving the testicle in the transverse plane. We're going to sweep the testicle in a superior to inferior fashion. The first thing we see in the near field is the scrotal wall. And deep to the scrotal wall, we see the testicle within the scrotum. We want to make sure that we sweep all the way through from top to bottom, superior to inferior to make sure that we cover all of the anatomy to rule out any abnormalities."

The first thing we want to identify in this clip is what this anechoic object in the near field is. This represents a moderately distended urinary bladder which provides us with an acoustic window for imaging the uterus and adjacent structures. Deep to the urinary bladder we see the uterus elongated with the endometrial stripe running centrally down the middle of the uterine body. Deep to the uterus we see a small amount of anechoic pelvic free fluid. In this instance we also see some anechoic free fluid in one of the adenoxal areas. This area represents the posterior cul-de-sac which is the most common area that we see pelvic free fluid when scanning transabdominally.

The first piece of anatomy we want to identify in this video is this large anechoic structure in the near field. This represents the distended urinary bladder which is actually extremely helpful when using a transabdominal imaging approach as it provides us with an acoustic window. Deep to the bladder we can see the uterus in cross section and as we sweep through the uterus in a superior to inferior fashion we see an echogenic object within the uterine body representing an IUD. Near the uterine fundus we can see a linear echogenic object extending crosswise through the uterine body. This represents the T portion of a properly positioned IUD. As we move inferiorly in the uterus we notice that it turns to more of an echogenic punctate object. This represents the T portion of a properly positioned IUD.

Leoma can get quite large and distort the uterine contour, making it difficult to distinguish where the uterus ends, and where the leoma begins. The first thing we notice in this image is the urinary bladder is not very distended. We can see a tiny sliver of anacolic fluid here, representing the urinary bladder. Here, in the near field, we can see a large, complex, appearing mass, which represents the leoma, which in this case is occupying most of the uterine body and fundus. The remainder of the uterine body can be seen here, deep to the large leoma."

Once I've positioned those appropriately, we can see that it gives us a reading. In this case, it's 169 beats per minute. If I'm happy with my measurement, I'm going to go ahead and capture an image. And we can unfreeze. And we can click the X over fetal heart zones, and that's going to take us back to B-mode imaging. And this is how we measure fetal heart rate using the butterfly. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
2nd Trimester - Survey,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/cRlqynIfRleB5z-82LpDJw,OB/GYN,2nd Trimester - Survey,Survey the uterus and placenta in the 2nd trimester,Adwana Clayton,8/18/2022,"We're going to do an overview of how to survey the uterus and placenta in a second trimester OB patient. So I'm going to start with my indicator towards the patient's head and I'm going to slide down kind of low here. But the first structure that we want to identify is going to be our patient's bladder, which we can see is moderately full here. And deep to that, we're going to see the cervix. And in this particular case, we can also see that baby's head is down. So once I've identified those structures, I'm going to move up midline with my indicator still pointed towards the patient's head. And this is going to allow us to survey the uterus and its long axis. I just decreased my depth a little bit to kind of maximize our imaging plane. As I'm moving along the uterus and the longitudinal plane here, another thing that I can take a look at is the position of the placenta, which in this case we can see is posterior. It's on the back wall of the uterus here. We can see that the leading edge of our placenta is here, adjacent to baby's head. I'm going to continue to follow this along, moving upward on my patient here. And I'm going to continue moving upward until I run into the fondest or the top of the uterus here. We can also see the edge of the placenta coming into view there. Once I've covered the uterus and its midline and long, it's a good opportunity for us to go ahead and evaluate the uterus off to the left and right sides to make sure that we don't see anything abnormal. So I'm just going to fan or tail my probe pointing towards the patient's right. We can see as we do that it allows us to move through the uterus out into our adenexal area. I'm going to come back to midline and I'm going to go ahead and fan or tail my transducer now pointing towards the patient's left to do the same thing to be able to utilize my full view of the uterus and take a good look out to the left and into the left adenexa. Once I've covered my uterus in the long plane, it's a good opportunity to go ahead and rotate the transducer so the indicator is now pointed towards my patient's right. This allows me to evaluate the uterus and its short axis. So I'm going to do the same thing. I'm going to kind of fan or tail down towards my patient's feet. This is going to allow me to get all the way down to the lower uterine segment. I'm going to continue sweeping down until I bump into my patient's bladder. That way I know I've covered the entire length of the uterus. I can now work my way back up. I'm going to slide and fan towards the patient's head. This is also going to give us a good opportunity to take another look at the placenta. Now in its short axis, we can see along the posterior wall of the uterus, this kind of bright, crescent-shaped structure being our placenta. I'm going to continue sliding towards my patient's head until I come all the way through the uterus, out the uterine fundus, until I don't see uterine anatomy anymore. That's an overview of how we evaluate the uterus and placenta and a second trimester OB patient with the butterfly. Thank you. for watching. for watching. [end of transcript] [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Charging the Butterfly,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/KkuFmcw1Qlu8eftotM9-Xg,Intro,Charging the Butterfly,Best practices for charging the Butterfly probe,Adwana Clayton,8/18/2022,"I'm going to show you how to ensure that you are adequately charging your butterfly probe. This right here is the cradle, the charging cradle, and we can see that there is a red light all the way around. It means that the cradle is not detecting anything on it. To adequately charge the transducer, what we want to see is this butterfly symbol, match up with a butterfly symbol on the cradle. I'm going to place the transducer on it, and we can see that the red light around here has turned to blue, which is good, and we can also see the charging indicators on top of the transducer. When it's fully charged, all four of these lights will illuminate, and the light around the cradle will turn green. If we place the transducer in an improper location, like so, we will see that the light around that charging cradle will actually begin to blink red, letting us know that it is in the wrong orientation. And that's how we ensure proper placement of our transducer on the charging cradle. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Ultrasound Guided Peripheral IV Insertion,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/d8viIfDVTsyR1kSGNe8H1w,Vascular Access,Ultrasound Guided Peripheral IV Insertion,Demonstrates the technique of using the Butterfly to guide the insertion of a peripheral IV catheter,Adwana Clayton,8/1/2022,"This is how you use your butterfly to insert a peripheral IV. The first thing that you need to do is put the tourniquet on the upper arm. You can do a survey scan when you're starting out, but there are so many veins in the arm that odds are you're going to find one. So I usually just put the tourniquet up first. So we will slip it back here. Basically put it up in the axilla and then we're going to give it a nice tight squeeze to make those veins get nice and plump for us. Good. Next is we're going to clean the arm from basically just inferior to where you have the tourniquet placed all the way up to about the mid forearm. I'm going to clean that whole area. Make sure that you get the underside or the more medial aspect of that upper arm because you have a bacilli vein there that often is very easy to cannulate. And after we've cleaned up, we're going to prep our transducer. You can use a sterile, clear adhesive dressing. And what I'm going to do is I am going to place the sticky side just on one side right here. Leave that side open. I'm going to put some gel on the inside. Now this gel does not need to be sterile because it's going to be on the inside of that adhesive dressing. And then I'm going to gently roll it over the top here. Now try your best to get all the bubbles out from the surface of that probe. I have a couple of bubbles there, but it'll be all right. Just make sure that you don't use your finger to smooth it out because then you've just introduced some contamination to the sterile dressing there. We will take off the tape. All right. Now I'm going to place a transducer on the inside of where I had that dressing. And our next step is going to be placing ultrasound gel over the arm. Now the ultrasound gel that you use on the arm, make sure that it's sterile. It's nice and clean. I'm just going to put a little dollop of gel right around the area where I think that I'm going to find a vein to cannulate. Now when you have your transducer, you always want to make sure that the probe marker is lining up with a probe marker on the screen. So I'm going to have the probe marker going to her right. Now make sure that you have the appropriate preset selected by hitting the preset button and scrolling over towards vascular access and selecting that. Now that we have that ready to go, we are going to start looking. Now I like to start just proximal to the any cubital fossa and we're seeing a quite large vessel right there. To make sure that it's not an artery, we're going to hold pressure. You can see that it is not pulsatile, so that is a vein. Now this one is a very large vein and probably the one I'm going to cannulate, but I'm going to look around for some other ones. I'm going to gently rotate the arm. We have some more vessels over here. We're seeing some pulsatile vessels there. These are arteries and there are some collapsible veins next to them. Those are a little bit smaller. Those are the brachial vessels and I'm going to hold their arm out here and show this blood vessel right here. Here's a collapsible one without pulsatility. This is the bacilic vein. So we have the bacilic vein. We have the brachial veins right here and then we have a large syphallic vein, which is the vein that we are going to cannulate today. We want to maximize our image by making sure that our depth is at the appropriate depth. We're going to go right about two centimeters and our gain is at a good gain. Want to write in the middle, I'm happy with that. Now what we want to do is we want to make sure that we know exactly the path of that vein and to do that we're going to slide up and down the arm. Now notice as I slide up and down the arm it's staying right in the center of my screen. That's good. That's what we want. Now let's say I was off access, if I slid it up and down, you see how it's moving side to side? That means that we are not perpendicular to that vein. So I'm just going to do this until as I move up and down, I am perpendicular to that vein, which means that if I bring my catheter perpendicular to the probe, we're going to be parallel to that vein, which is what we want. So now that I've selected exactly what I want, I'm going to go ahead and get my IV catheter. I'm going to get my extension tubing ready to go. And this is actually pretty important. You want to make sure that you have your dressing ready to go as well as some gauze ready to go because you want to make sure there's no gel in the area when you put the dressing on top of that. So now that we have that, we're going to go ahead and get the probe ready. I'm going to get our needle and we are going to identify the vein again right here. And we do have other settings available. If you hit that Actions tab, we have our biplane, which can be utilized. We have our needle vis, which we can use, and that's if we do long access approach. And then we can also use our midline button here. I'm going to not use those and go ahead and cannulate this syphallic vein. Make sure that you have the bevel facing up and then center it. Now what I like to do always is I will brace. So notice I have my hand brace. I have my propane brace as well because we don't want to slide. And I'm looking up, looking down right before I stick, making sure that I'm midline here. So I'm midline with the ultrasound screen. I am looking down, looking up, making sure that my puncture side is good. And here we have a big poke. Now I'm going to go just a little distal. Do my poke right there. And then once I get it under the skin, I'm going to fan and slide my transducer a little more distally until I see a hypercoic ditzel. You see it right there? And then I am really close to that vein already and I'm pretty midline. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use something called sequential needle tip tracking. Once I see that point right there, I'm going to move my transducer approximately until that dot disappears. Now I'm going to move my needle. I'll see it again. Then I'm going to keep doing that structure so on and so forth until I find myself right in the center of that lumen. Now once I see the catheter tip in the lumen, we're not done. I want to make sure that I can get it further in that lumen so that I don't either go through that back wall or actually I slip out the anterior part of the superficial part of the vein wall. I'm going to keep actually threading it into that vein as I flatten out the needle. Now what you can do also is you can check and just make sure that you're in the appropriate location. There I am. And once you have that visualized, what you can do is you can put your transducer down and you can go ahead and slide your catheter in. Now once you hold down some pressure there, what we're going to do is we're going to attach the extension tubing here. We're going to go ahead and aspirate, make sure there's no air in there. And we'll go ahead and flush. Now we do have some ultrasound gel in that area with a little bit of blood there so we're going to grab our gauze and let's go ahead and wipe all of this off. I'm going to undo that tourniquet. I'm going to go ahead and clean her all the way off here. Now always make sure that you never accidentally pull out that catheter which can happen. What I do is I'll tilt it just a little bit and make sure that I'm fully cleaned. And then once we have that clean, let's move our stopper there out of the way. We'll go ahead and put in our dressing. We'll go ahead and remove the white outer border of this dressing. Now we can use this little strip right here to go ahead and secure the more distal aspect of that IV here. We can go ahead and make sure that it's still working which it is. Remove it and now you have a functional IV. And that's how you use your butterfly transducer to place a peripheral IV. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Needle Viz,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/mZvLKgoiQiGrt6XcyjMHwg,Soft Tissue/MSK,Needle Viz,Learn how to better visualize the needle for inplane procedures with Needle Viz.,Adwana Clayton,5/11/2022,"When set up for a procedure, either in plane or out of plane, sometimes the tissue, particularly in the sole of the foot, can be so dense that needles can be difficult to portray using B mode. One of the tools to be able to support visualization of the needle is a technology called needle viz. As the needle enters the patient from the side of the probe with the blue dot, at the halfway point, you'll notice here the echogenic line appearing in the image. If this was difficult to see, for example, if there was scar tissue, you could go ahead and press the actions menu and needle viz, as you see here. This applies a technology as I swipe right and left that will highlight the needle in brilliant butterfly blue to make it easier to see. And that's how you can use needle viz to help you guide injections using the butterfly. [BLANK_AUDIO]"

The first thing we'll do is ensure we're in the correct preset by using the preset button like this. We'll check we're using musculoskeletal and then press select. I'll then ask the patient to pull their toes up towards their head so the foot is flat like this. I'll ensure that the probe is placed against the heel with the blue dot towards the ceiling so that it corresponds with the blue dot that you see on the left hand side of the screen. I'll place the probe over the medial portion of the calcaneus. I swipe up to ensure the depth is optimal and the anatomies in the centre of the screen. I'll swipe right and left to ensure the overall gain or brightness of the image is optimal also. I can freeze by pressing the snowflake and I'll adjust the linear measurement like this. I'll use the blue dots to drag the crosshairs to both ends of the height of the plantar fascia using the magnifying glass that you see in the top right hand side of the screen. The measurement appears in yellow like this. When I unfreeze the image in order to perform an injection I go ahead and place the needle in the heel here. Because I'm using the blue dot to guide my orientation the needle will show up in the image near the blue dot on the left. The needle will show in plane and as you withdraw the needle the steroid will land in a sheet across the top of the insertion of the plantar fascia. And that's how we perform a study of the plantar fascia using the butterfly IQ+. [BLANK_AUDIO]
Tarsometatarsal Joints,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/JK0MBt2uTTS8fGSOh568zQ,Soft Tissue/MSK,Tarsometatarsal Joints,An ultrasound exam of the tarsometatarsal joints typical for the investigation of midfoot arthritis,Adwana Clayton,5/11/2022,"Let's perform a study of the Tasso Metatasso joints, also known as the Liz Frank joints, typical for investigation of midfoot arthritis, using the butterfly IQ. The first thing I'll do is make sure that I'm in the appropriate preset. I do so by pressing the preset button and making sure that the musculoskeletal option is selected. I'll ask my patient to lie flat on her back and bend her knee so her foot is flat on the examination table. When I place the probe over the midfoot, it's important that the blue dot is facing upwards towards the patient's head. When I place the first probe down over the first metatastal, I'll move side to side in the image until I see the white line that indicates the cortex of the first metatastal. I'll swipe down on the device until that metatastal line is in the centre of the image. I'll also swipe side to side to make sure that the overall brightness or gain of the image is optimal. I'll then slide up towards the patient's head until I see the first Tasso metatastal joint, which is indicated here. In this way, the medial cuneiform will be on the left hand side of the screen and the first metatastal head will be on the right hand side of the screen. In the centre of the image, you see the black area, which is indicative of the joint. In order to follow the joint line across, laterally, to the second through fifth Tasso metatastal joints, I simply slide the probe towards the patient's fifth metatastal, like this. I'll need to adjust toe to heel as these joints vary in position. Here you see now the medial cuneiform on the left hand side of the screen and the second metatastal on the right. I slide again. Lateral cuneiform on the left, third metatastal on the right. And so on through the foot, through the fourth Tasso metatastal joint, you see here, cuboid on the left, fourth metatastal on the right, and then across to the fifth. In this way, I'm interrogating every joint in the midfoot from the first metatastal tassel joint all the way across to the fifth. If I do a procedure of an injection into the midfoot in the Tasso metatastal joints, it's important that the needle comes towards the marker, which will indicate the centre of the screen and therefore the centre of the joint. I do so with the needle entering from this direction such that the needle is in short axis and comes towards me as an echogenic dot. When I see that, I am confident I'm in the centre of the joint and I can go ahead and inject the steroid in anesthetic. And that's how you perform a study of the Tasso metatastal joints, also known as the lilies fronk joints in an investigation for midfoot arthritis with the butterfly device. [BLANK_AUDIO]"

The first thing we'll do is make sure we're in the appropriate preset. I'll do so by pressing the preset button and ensuring that the musculoskeletal option is selected. I'll ask the patient to lie flat on their back to bend their knee and have their foot flat on the examination table. When I place my probe over the first metatarsal phalangeal joint, it's important that the blue dot is facing towards the patient's head. When I do so, the metatarsal head will be on the left hand side of the screen, as you see here, and the proximal phalanx will be on the right hand side of the screen. I will then swipe down to make sure that the anatomy is in the centre of the screen. I'll also swipe right to left to make sure that the overall gain or brightness of the image is optimal. In between the metatarsal head, which appears echogenic on the left hand side of the screen and the proximal phalanx on the right, you'll notice a black stripe in the centre of the image. That's the first metatarsal phalanxial joint. You'll also notice the extensorhalus' longest tendon running over the top of the joint, within the first centimetre of the image. When I perform an injection, I can use the marker on the butterfly probe to ensure I'm in the centre of the screen, therefore the centre of the image, and therefore right in the middle of the metatarsal phalanxial joint in order to introduce steroid and anesthetic, or to make sure I'm in a great spot for my aspiration.

The first thing to do is to ensure you're in the correct preset. I'll do so by pressing the preset button and ensuring that the musculoskeletal preset is selected. I'll then ensure that the patient's toes are pulled up towards the patient's head to make sure that the calf is flexed. Next, I'll ensure that I have a liberal amount of gel from the proximal calf all the way down to the distal calf in order to cover the distal insertion of the attendant onto the calcaneus. As you place the probe, make sure that the blue dot is facing towards the patient's head, like this. I'll then drag the image up or down to make sure that the centre of the screen has the anatomy of interest. I'll also make sure that I scan right and left on the screen to make sure that the overall brightness or gain of the image is optimal also. You'll notice the calcaneus as the echogenic line on the right-hand side of the screen. Above that, attaching itself to the bone is the Achilles tendon. As I scan up towards the patient's head, you'll notice a black circle in the centre of the screen. That's the retrocalcaneal bursa. I'll then continue scanning with the probe, dragging it slowly and constantly all the way up to the proximal calf. The longitudinal fibres of the Achilles tendon are what you see at the one centimetre mark on the clinical image. You'll notice the tendon is diving deeper and deeper the more proximal that we go. It's important in assessing the Achilles tendon to scan all the way along its length until it reaches the musculotendinous junction. If I'm going to perform an injection, I turn the probe 90 degrees so that the blue dot is facing towards myself. I place the probe at the distal insertion of the Achilles and I bring the needle typically in from this side of the foot. It will appear as an echogenic line in plane coming in from the right hand side of the screen. I'll aim to have the needle above the calcaneal line, below the Achilles tendon and enter directly into the retrocalcaneal bursa, which is where I will inject the steroid and anesthetic mixture.

The first thing I'm going to do is ensure that I'm in the appropriate preset. I do so by pressing the preset button and ensuring that the musculoskeletal option is selected. I'll ask my patient to roll up onto her side so the affected side is up. I use a small towel or pillow underneath the ankle in order to elevate and also allow room for inversion. When I place the probe across the ankle in the short axis, it's important that the blue indicator marker is facing towards me. That way the blue dot on the screen will delineate the anterior portion of the foot. As I place the probe down, I'll go ahead and swipe down to make sure that the anatomy is in the centre of the screen. I'll then go ahead and swipe right or left to ensure that the gain or brightness of the image is also appropriate for the study. You'll notice on the left hand side of the screen I see an echogenic curved surface. This is the head of the fibula. Behind the fibula you'll see two echogenic circles, one above the other. The circle above is the perineus longus. The circle below is perineus brevis. You'll see perineus brevis attaching to its muscle below and deep. The way I remember this is longus on top, brevis is below near the bone. If you turn your eye to the first few millimetres of tissue, you'll notice a linear striation which is the retinaculum. This is the typical location for the investigation of subluxation using ultrasound. As I hold my probe steady, I'll ask the patient to rotate their ankle and invert. I'm checking the dynamic manoeuvre between the longus and brevis and making sure that that's an appropriate relationship. That there's no overly click to that relationship and they stay relatively stagnant in their movement. And that's how we help to rule out perineal subluxation as the cause for a clicking ankle using the butterfly. [BLANK_AUDIO]"

This is shown by the bright echogenic line across the image. I then go ahead and adjust my gain by swiping right or left to ensure that the cortical margin is clear and distinct. I then slide my probe all the way along the metatarsal. You'll notice that the bone is echogenic, flat and continuous. This is very typical of a cortical line that's normal. As you reach the area of the metatarsal where the patient has pain, gently press to confirm her in the appropriate area. What we're looking for here is a dark area surrounding that echogenic line that's typical of hyperimia.

I place the probe down across the short axis of the ankle and I swipe down to make sure that the anatomy is in the centre of the screen. I can also swipe right or left to make sure that the overall brightness or gain of the image is appropriate for the study. The structures of the TASL tunnel will start anteriorly with the posterior tibial tendon which is that echogenic area just above the bony structure. Moving posterior from there, you'll then see the FDL, the flexidigitorum longus, next to the PTT. In posterior and inferior to that, you'll see a number of anechoic structures. If, if you lift your probe's pressure, you'll notice blinking of the posterior tibial veins as they compress, but the consistency of the round structure of the artery in the centre. Post-irior to that, you'll see the typical honeycomb appearance of the posterior tibial nerve. If you keep an inferior to that, you'll see flexidigitorum longus tucked in posteriorly.

Manual Bladder Volume,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/zFp2wOo4RtCILEDBUKNdhg,Genitourinary,Manual Bladder Volume,An overview of how to calculate a manual bladder volume,Adwana Clayton,5/5/2022,"Let's walk through the steps for obtaining a manual bladder volume. First, we need to be in the correct preset, bladder, select. And the next thing we want to do is go to the Actions tab and activate our manual volume calculation. Once that's activated, we can go ahead and start scanning. I'm going to take my transducer, start in the transverse plane with the indicator towards the patient's right. When you put down the transducer, if you don't see the bladder itself, you're most likely a bit too superior. I'm going to go a little, just angle a bit down and slide down. You need to be almost to the level of the pugic synthesis, angling down into the pelvis. Slowly fanning up and down, inferior to superior. I'm going to find the area of the maximal width. Once I'm happy with my image, it's nice and centered on my screen, I can freeze, activate our measurements tool, and select the first diameter. Placing the calipers in order to find the width here. Confirm. Next, I'm going to go back to that measurements tool and select the second diameter. Place the calipers to get the depth and confirm. Save my image and then unfreeze. Rotating my transducer, so the indicators towards the patient's head, we can now see the sagittal. Again, I'm trying to center it on my screen, and fan left to right, coming back to center, freeze my image, go back to my measurements tool, select the third diameter, and measure from apex to base. Once I'm happy with that, I can confirm. And as you can see, on the bottom of the screen, we now have a volume. It appears there's just shy of 250 milliliters in this bladder at this time. And these are the steps for obtaining a manual bladder volume. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
M-Mode,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/9bytuWkNRUqBg7xXI2rwPg,Intro,M-Mode,An overview of M-Mode imaging,Adwana Clayton,5/5/2022,M-mode or motion mode imaging is a useful tool for measuring fetal heart rate in a really pregnancy and is also used for cardiac measurements like E-point septal separation. Some users also like to use M-mode for certain long applications or for evaluating the inferior vena cava. How do we activate M-mode? We just go into the Actions tab and press M-mode. We'll get a vertical M-mode cursor or spike down the middle of the screen and I'm going to perform M-mode on the radial artery right here. So I'm going to center that over the spike and apply a little bit of pressure and now we can see on the top half the M-mode image that periodic repetitive pattern from the pulsations of the radial artery. The depth on this screen corresponds to the depth on the M-mode screen and if we want to do a measurement we can press the Annotations tab and select Line and we can measure the pulse by going peak to peak on one cycle and that'll get me the pulse which is currently 55 beats per minute. I can unfreeze at this point and if I want to return to standard imaging I can simply X out of M-mode and I'm back into B-mode imaging.
Echogenicities,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/Z3ukwvJ3QUeLmpfSYAI1eQ,Intro,Echogenicities,This is an overview of the different echogenicities of structures seen on ultrasound,Adwana Clayton,5/5/2022,"Next, let's talk about echogenic structures. So the term echogenic just means that it generates echoes. And what generates echoes? Strong reflectors of ultrasound beams. So in this case, we're looking at an echogenic curved structure right here in the near field of the image. And that's my radius bone. So what happens is the ultrasound beam comes down and hits the bone. It's reflected strongly from the bone because ultrasound doesn't travel well through bone. And as a result, it's echogenic or bright white. We also see that the ultrasound doesn't penetrate the bone by noticing this acoustic shadow deep to the bone because the ultrasound can't get through. So what kinds of structures are echogenic? Well, the cortex of bones are echogenic. Stones, whether gallstones or renal stones are echogenic. A needle is echogenic on ultrasound. So during procedural guidance, a needle will appear white or echogenic. And then any time there's a strong reflection of ultrasound. So when you change between two very different tissue densities at the diaphragm, for example, between an air filled lung and the liver, which conducts ultrasound well, you'll have a strong reflection at the diaphragm. And that'll also be echogenic. So bones, stones, needles and strong reflectors will be echogenic structures will encounter while performing ultrasound exams."
Anechoic,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/eIcE4cyZSXWHtMIwaOA_Kw,Intro,Anechoic,This video is an overview of structures that are anechoic on ultrasound,Adwana Clayton,5/5/2022,"Next, we're going to talk about anechoic structures. Anechoic simply means no echoes, or black, on an ultrasound image. And a structure looks black, or anechoic, if there's no echoes returning to the butterfly after sound waves have penetrated that structure. What structures allow sound waves to transmit without returning to the butterfly? Fluid. So in this case, we've got multiple circular anechoic structures in the near field at the top of this image. Those are my veins and my radial artery. And if I compress, I'm left with just one anechoic structure, the radial artery right there in the center. What other things look anechoic on ultrasound? Well, bile within the gallbladder, blood within the chambers of the heart, or within the larger vessels like the abdominal aorta, or vena cava. You're in within the bladder, or within a distended renal pelvis in someone with hydroenterphrosis. So anytime you're looking at a black or anechoic structure on ultrasound, that's a fluid-filled structure. And that can help you identify the anatomical area that you're investigating."

Color,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/w_485bjPTLKTjiwnL-T_5g,Intro,Color,An overview of color doppler imaging,Adwana Clayton,5/5/2022,"Let's talk about color and power Doppler. We use color and power Doppler to detect blood flow and in a point of care ultrasound setting that can be to determine if an anechoic structure is vascular or not it can be to look for inflammation in a musculoskeletal setting or to look at transvalvular flow in a cardiac setting. So how do we activate these modes? We press the Actions tab, select color Doppler and we're now getting directional color flow information off of the radial artery. I can change the velocity to high flow or low flow by tapping at the bottom and I can swipe right to increase color gain. I can swipe left to decrease color gain. To exit color Doppler I'm going to press the X next to color Doppler and to activate power Doppler I'll go back to the Actions tab, select power Doppler and power Doppler is going to give us the same information as color in the setting of detecting flow but it won't give us directional information. Power Doppler is really useful for low flow states to look for the presence or absence of flow but won't give us information about which direction the blood is flowing. To exit out there X next to power Doppler and I'm brought back to B mode and that's how you activate color and power Doppler. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
B-Mode Imaging,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/KRTWIzBzTmyj-W1h-3Lm2A,Intro,B-Mode Imaging,An overview of B-Mode imaging,Adwana Clayton,5/5/2022,"B-mode or brightness mode imaging, also known as 2D or grayscale imaging, is what we all think of when we think of ultrasound. It's a varying degree of black, gray, and white that we see represented on a two-dimensional screen. B-mode is the workhorse of point-of-care ultrasound imaging. You're going to be able to perform 90 to 95 percent of point-of-care exams using B-mode alone, and as a result it's the default node that will launch when you open the scan screen in in the butterfly app. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Transducer Pressure,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/SYaC3-H2QCaMPX9gc74xaA,Intro,Transducer Pressure,An overview the importance of proper transducer pressure,Adwana Clayton,5/5/2022,"So we talk about applying pressure when doing ultrasound examinations and putting enough pressure on to get a good image. And when people first get started they're really uncomfortable with pressing hard. Yeah of course the last thing that you want to do is hurt your patient. 100%. So we're gonna take the opportunity to show you an appropriate amount of pressure and how it may be more than what you're anticipating in terms of what patients can tolerate and in terms of what I'll get you a good image. So let's take a look with the abdominal aorta. Sounds great. Go ahead here midline, put my transducer down and take a look to see if I can locate the the aorta. So I'm seeing a few hypoacolic areas that could be potentially the aorta here. Yeah and if I had to guess at this level I'd say we're probably gonna be down around 9, 10 centimeters here that's gonna be what we look at for the abdominal aorta and I'm pointing out that depth for a reason because Janet's not really applying pressure right now. She's applying enough pressure to make probe contact. We have good contact with the skin but we're not scanning the way either you or myself would scan during a real exam while we were trying to get a good look. Correct. So why don't you go ahead and show us what that pressure kind of looks like. And you can see how much pressure Janet's applying just by looking at the probe itself on the skin. But if you look at the image itself you've now got a really clear image of the abdominal aorta. We could probably even decrease we don't have to right now but could decrease the depth just to get a better image because we're now looking at the aorta at around 5 to 6 centimeters instead of 9 to 10 centimeters. So my math isn't great but that's about 4 centimeters of compression and patients tolerate this tremendously well. It's not painful sometimes you'll feel pressure but you're applying pressure. And I think that makes a huge difference in terms of getting a quality exam. For sure."
Storing Images and Clips,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/N7zxV5wbSj65171e76TiFA,Intro,Storing Images and Clips,An overview of how to capture still images and clips using the Butterfly,Adwana Clayton,5/5/2022,"So saving clips and still images is integral to doing a point of care ultrasound exam. And we're going to demonstrate how to save still images and how to save clips, and we'll start with still images. So what are we looking at, Janet? Alright, so I'm here in the left upper quadrant with the indicator towards the patient's left shoulder, and we're looking through this plane down to the left kidney. So if we want to save a still image of the left kidney, we're going to press freeze. We are. Although I think I had it a little bit nicer just a couple of frames ago. So I've gone and I'm now scrolling back and through until I find a slice that I really like, and then I'm going to select that. Once that's done, I can hit the camera button and save my image. And that's showing up as a one in the exam reel, showing that we've saved one image thus far. That Cine tool records several seconds' worth of information up until that freeze. So you can sort of just hit freeze just a second too late from what you wanted to capture. That's where it really comes in handy as you can go ahead and scroll back. And then how about a video clip? Yeah, let's document that we've looked at the entirety of this kidney. So I'm going to fan medially until I'm all the way through the tissue. Then I'm going to hit the camera button and fan laterally all the way through. And by hitting stop, we're saving that clip. And that's a second image showing up in the exam reel. Clips can be anywhere from a second up to 60 seconds. Generally, I save clips in sort of the two to six second range, but if you have an institutional guideline around clip length, obviously follow that. The longer clips can be useful for procedures if you want to document the entire procedure under ultrasound guidance. And then most structures can be evaluated in images or still images or clips documented depending on what exam you're doing in your own practice. Certain things need to be done with clips. If you need to document motion, the best way to do that is with a clip. So that's going to be largely, you know, cardiac, you're going to want to document clips for your cardiac studies because structure and emotion are both integral to that particular type of exam. And that's how you save clips and still images with butterfly. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Adjusting Depth,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/cnKJtRnHTdCBQaMCp5sdRg,Intro,Adjusting Depth,An overview of how to adjust the depth on the Butterfly,Adwana Clayton,5/5/2022,"One of the most important controls to adjust when you're optimizing your ultrasound image is depth. Now depth corresponds to how deeply we're looking into tissue. At the top of the screen that corresponds to my skin and at the bottom of the screen that's deep into tissue and that's an adjustable parameter on butterfly. Now on the right we can see this scale in centimeters so we're looking three centimeters deep into the tissue. Let's pretend that I was looking to evaluate my median nerve which is this triangular hyperechoic structure in the center of the screen. This is a decent depth, it's okay. If I wanted to really optimize it I would swipe down to decrease my depth slightly and now I have the structure, the median nerve in this case, centered from top to bottom on the screen and that's what we're really looking to achieve. Now where are the pitfalls? Well if I swipe down all the way and decrease the depth to one centimeters I've now cut off the bottom portion or the deep portion of the median nerve in this case so I'm failing to fully evaluate the structure of interest and on the flip side if I swipe up and increase my depth to say 11 centimeters now the median nerve is all the way at the top I have scanned through my forearm and this curved structure is actually the other side of my arm so I have a lot of useless information that's corresponding to the air on the other side of my arm and I can't really get any good definition on the structure of interest because it's tiny and it's located all the way at the top in the near field so when you're setting an appropriate depth work on getting the structure of interest centered from top to bottom on the screen and that's a generally good guideline that'll help you obtain high quality images for interpretation. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Adjusting Gain,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/mQ4KvcIhSXKFYncVdw2JeQ,Intro,Adjusting Gain,An overview of how to adjust the gain on the Butterfly,Adwana Clayton,5/5/2022,"Gain is one of the key controls we'll want to adjust in order to optimize our ultrasound image. And there really isn't a perfect gain setting. Gain is pretty subjective. Some people like to have the gain set a little bit on the higher side like here. So it's a bright image but I can tell the nerve in the center of the screen from the fascia here from the muscle here. Or some people might want to scan with a slightly lower gain and especially in a more dimly lit room. You may scan with a lower gain versus a higher gain in a brighter room. I adjust gain as we're seeing by swiping left and right. And it's just important to know that if you swipe too far left and really decrease the gain you're gonna have a hard time identifying structures. And if you swipe too far to the right and increase the gain past a certain threshold, everything's gonna start to look too hypericolic or too echogenic and you're gonna have a hard time differentiating one structure from another adjacent structure. Additionally, if you increase the gain too much you may cause false echoes to appear in an otherwise anechoic structure so that can give you confusing information. So I would recommend scanning somewhere towards the middle range. You can adjust to your own taste but that's how you operate gain to optimize your image and get accurate information."
Choosing the Right Preset,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/X7B7vGSlRSaffWV0kRPYOA,Intro,Choosing the Right Preset,An overview of how to choose the correct preset for your exam,Adwana Clayton,5/5/2022,"Because we can use butterfly to scan the entire body, we need to make sure that we're choosing the appropriate preset so that the images adjusted and optimized for the structures that we're evaluating. We can tap the preset button here and see that I'm in a musculoskeletal soft tissue preset. And if I stay in that preset, we can see that we're able to evaluate bone, muscle, nerve, tendon, and this is an appropriate preset for the image that I'm evaluating right now. Now if we wanted to look at the vessels with a little more clarity up at the top of the screen there, I'd want to switch into a vascular preset and I can change to vascular access in this case and decrease my depth a little bit. And we can see very clear definition of the radial artery because we're now in the appropriate preset. Now minor adjustments like vascular and musculoskeletal for a given exam may help us get a better look at a specific structure anatomically that we want to investigate but it's also really important to make sure we're not in a completely inappropriate preset. Some of the preset functionality could be you know really taste-based or subjective where you might want to look with musculoskeletal soft tissue versus musculoskeletal. But you definitely wouldn't want to look at a musculoskeletal study with something like a cardiac preset. And we can see that when we change into that preset we have really an uninterpretable image even if I were to decrease depth maximally. I can't see the artery, the vein, tendon, nerve, muscle, etc. because I'm in the inappropriate preset. So changing presets will optimize the gain, depth, frequency and really get us the appropriate image so that we can get clear answers to the clinical questions we're asking as we're performing ultrasound."
Orientation,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/YXB51GkdQCOFeOlMh0DOww,Intro,Orientation,An introduction to transducer and anatomic orientation,Adwana Clayton,5/5/2022,"So one of the first fundamental principles we want to review is orientation. How do you tell what direction on the imaging screen correlates to the patient in front of you and where you're looking anatomically? So let's get started with that. The easiest direction to understand on the screen is the skin surface. That's always going to be the top of the screen and where you're applying the butterfly. So if I go ahead and apply it to my forearm here, the top of the screen corresponds to the skin right here where I'm applying the butterfly. Now if you think of the butterfly as a flashlight, instead of shooting light, it's shooting sound, the deeper you go on the screen is the further you're shooting sound into the tissue. So further away from the skin surface is going to be the bottom of the screen. So that's the top and the bottom of the screen, but how do we tell the left from the right? That's where the directional indicator comes in. There's only one blue dot on the butterfly. So if we turn all the way around, there are blue lines that mark the center, which can be useful for procedural guidance, but there's only one blue dot and that's the directional indicator. There's also only one blue B on the screen. So that blue dot corresponds to that side of the image where the blue B is located. If I go ahead and place the butterfly on my skin, I have the blue dot oriented towards the radial side of my forearm. If I slide towards the blue dot, I'm sliding radially and that's the radius. If I slide away from the blue dot, I'm sliding to the other side of the forearm or the ulnar side of the forearm and in fact that's my ulnar over there. So that's left and right towards the indicator, away from the indicator and skin surface and deep into tissue for top and bottom. If you're ever sliding left or right and you think the image is moving in a way you don't anticipate, just double check that you have the directional indicator oriented in the way you expected.

Gel and the Butterfly,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/nJboBY3PSfiVmLHRPxZtNw,Intro,Gel and the Butterfly,An overview of the importance of gel when using the Butterfly,Adwana Clayton,5/5/2022,"So let's talk about ultrasound gel. Now ultrasound gel is really important because it removes air between the butterfly and the skin and allows sound to travel into tissues so we can get an image we can interpret. If we're not using gel and we just place the butterfly on the skin, I don't really see anything. You know if I have a little bit of dried gel there so I might get an old image if I press really hard but you won't get a good image for interpretation if you don't have gel on the patient. So how much gel to use? Well you know you want to use enough that you get a clear image and you don't want to use so much that you're slipping and sliding all over the place because the skin surface is over gelled. So just enough you'll learn really quickly what a good amount of gel is and I'd like to have enough where I'm able to kind of slide up and down the area of interest without having to regel because I only used a tiny bit. Now I'm using bottle gel for this demonstration. Many institutions have guidelines around using individual gel packets to reduce nosocomial spread of infection so definitely follow your institutional practices when it comes to individual gel packets versus a gel bottle. And then lastly around gel I would just say that if you're trying to evaluate an oddly shaped area of the body or a really painful structure like an abscess or a very tender area of cellulitis you can build a gel bridge. So just pile up a bunch of gel like I just did and you can place the butterfly onto that while not really putting any real pressure on the skin itself and this black area at the top of the screen that's the gel bridge there and there's the skin and I'm able to evaluate structures at the skin level and just below the skin without having to put direct pressure on the area that could be painful or otherwise uncomfortable to scan. And those are really core principles about ultrasound gel and how to use it in your scanning practice."
Holding the Butterfly,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/lLkryirKT8OVrv97sXXFrA,Intro,Holding the Butterfly,An overview of how to properly hold the Butterfly,Adwana Clayton,5/5/2022,"So one of the basic core principles I want to review early on is how to hold the butterfly itself. Now holding it is really important even though it sounds really basic. If you think about it, in medicine we're used to holding instruments deliberately. We hold a laryngoscope with a proper grip, we hold a scalpel with a proper grip, and it's no different with butterfly. So we're going to demonstrate how to hold the probe incorrectly. So if I put the probe on and I hold the butterfly from the tail end by the cord, and hold it tentatively with my fingertips, which is how sometimes new users will approach holding the probe. You can see that I'm having a hard time even just keeping it still. Ultrasound gel is slippery. We're often scanning non-flat surfaces on patients. So there's a natural curve to my forearm here, and as a result I'm having a hard time holding the probe still. So don't hold it by the tail end, don't hold it tentatively, don't hold it like a club because it's pretty hard to get fine motor control when you're holding something like this. You want to hold it with your thumb and either middle finger or index finger or both, close to the scanning surface, close to the skin, and you want to brace your other fingers on the patient. This lets me hold the probe perfectly still, or adjust for really fine movements so I can move just millimeters at a time in whatever direction I want to obtain the image that I want. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Activating the Butterfly,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/uY9sbpwgT72qRXmfdUjUFg,Intro,Activating the Butterfly,An overview of plugging the Butterfly into your device and getting started,Adwana Clayton,5/5/2022,"Hi, I'm Mike Stone. I'm an emergency physician and a point-of-care ultrasound educator. And I'm going to introduce you to the butterfly system. We're going to talk in this series of videos around core essential functionality of the system, as well as review basic point-of-care ultrasound principles and technique. So I'm going to start off by plugging into the phone. Here I have the app already installed, and I'm going to plug in the butterfly, and it'll prompt me to launch the app, which I'm going to allow. And you can see I'm already in the scan screen and ready to start scanning. We're going to hold off on scanning for a second, and I'm just going to familiarize us with the screen we're looking at. So here we have the imaging area, the scale along the right side and centimeters to give us our depth. We have the presets button, which will take us into our presets menu, where we can choose from a number of presets, depending on the exam we want to perform. Freeze, camera button to record a CineClip, which we'll cover later. The Actions tab, which if we open, has a lot of options from labeling to modes to educational resources and teleguidance. This will change depending on what preset you're in, as different options will be relevant to that preset. We have the image reel on the top right. This keeps track of the studies that we've stored, and at this point, since we haven't started scanning, it's reading zero. That's also where you'll go into input patient demographics when you're ready to save and upload your study. And then on the top left, we have the carrot that'll take us into settings, preferences, and additional controls, as well as our image archive to review prior studies that we've saved. So that's a general overview of the scan screen, and we'll get into some scanning principles and basics next. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Introduction to Butterfly,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/P_vaLltaSPW8-_7--M2rAw,Intro,Introduction to Butterfly,An introduction to the basic functions of the Butterfly,Adwana Clayton,5/5/2022,"When I was first starting out with ultrasound, one of the things that I found really useful was to scan myself. It let me practice in a consequence-free environment where I wasn't worried about looking silly in front of a patient or causing discomfort. The two places where I found it most useful to start were the forearm where I could look at nerves, tendon, vascular structures, bone and muscle and the carotid artery where I could look at the artery itself as well as the internal jugular vein, the thyroid and surrounding structures. In the following series of videos, I'm going to be scanning myself over my forearm and walking through some core ultrasound techniques and principles as well as getting us familiar with the butterfly system. Feel free to follow along with your own system."
E-Point Septal Separation (EPSS),https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/UE6y1AqVQcuxUOdEk0k9ww,Cardiac,E-Point Septal Separation (EPSS),An overview of performing the E-Point Septal Separation measurement,Adwana Clayton,5/5/2022,"So we're going to show you how to obtain an E-point septal separation or EPSS measurement using the butterfly. Great, let's do it. So I'm going to go ahead and start by selecting the presets, go into cardiac, selecting that. With my indicator towards the right shoulder, I'm going to place the butterfly just to the left of sternum and do some slow circles. I call this window shopping. Perfect. So nice parisor in a long axis view. We can see the anterior mitral valve leaflet coming up and getting really close to the septum in diastole. We anticipate this is going to be a normal measurement, but one of the nice things about E-point septal separation measurements is it's a single linear measurement that gives you some insight into left ventricular contractility and systolic function. So from here, I can see you already going over into the actions tab to drop an M-mode spike or cursor. And once we get that M-mode cursor over the anterior mitral valve leaflet, we'll start to see that E and A-point of the diastolic motion of the mitral valve. And once we feel like we've got a good view of that tracing, that looks phenomenal, we'll freeze and we can measure, but in this case, we can tell that the anterior mitral valve leaflet actually comes up and hits against the septum in early diastole. So that's an E-point septal separation of zero. Anything less than seven millimeters is considered normal as a measurement. And it's important to know that there's limitations to E-point septal separation. It can't be the only thing you do to look at systolic function. People with aortic valve disease, mitral valve disease, you're not going to get accurate measurements. But it's a nice easy tool for novices to get an extra checkpoint of what the LV systolic function looks like. If we were to measure this, I would go to the Measurements tab, select Line, and then place the calipers from the septum down to the E-point, which here is less than two millimeters. Fantastic.

Focused Cardiac Protocol,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/7LXV8cidQdWZ4_QZzq1ssw,Cardiac,Focused Cardiac Protocol,An overview of the focused cardiac ultrasound protocol ,Adwana Clayton,5/4/2022,"So we're going to walk you through a focused cardiac ultrasound. Now there's lots of cardiac windows, there's apical windows, peristernal, super sternal, subcostal. When I do a focused cardiac ultrasound, it's really a peristernal long and short in an apical forward chamber and a subcostal long axis or a subcostal forward chamber. So why don't we go ahead and walk through, take us away. Alright, going to our presets, selecting our cardiac preset. Fantastic. I'm going to take my indicator towards the patient's right shoulder, placing the transducer just to the left of the sternum and doing some small circles to find my window. Alright, so a couple of things I want to point out. One, we're in a left lateral to cubitist position, which is really useful. Opens up the rib spaces, also brings the heart closer to the chest wall, so that's something you can try every time when you scan a patient, it's going to make it easier for you to see. The butterfly's to the left of the sternum there and the indicator's pointing right up to the right shoulder, as Janet pointed out, and that circle motion. Now you've landed on the heart in a nice peristernal long axis, but if you land off the heart and you're struggling, those wide circles that she's taking there really will get you that right window and let you land in an intercostal space where you can see what you're looking for. And in this case, we've got left ventricle, mitral valve, left atrium, aortic root, and right ventricle, we're not going to point out all of the anatomy in each one of these views. Let's go ahead and save a quick clip so that we can document and make sure that this is like real life, and then once we have a clip, we'll move on to a peristernal short axis. So I'm going to now take the butterfly and rotate it so my indicator is towards the left shoulder, around a 90 degree rotation, clockwise, and here I can see that we're at the level of the mitral valve. I'd like to be at the level of the papillary muscles in order to really take a look at the squeeze of that left ventricle, so I'm going to fan down towards the apex. All right, and here we're getting into more of a mid-ventricular view of the left ventricle. I find when I'm doing a peristernal short, you know, it seems intuitive that you'd go from along to a short just by rotating and everything would be hunky dory. There's times where you need to re- kind of circle the probe a little bit just to get that nice view. And in this case, you've got a great mid-ventricular view of the left ventricle there with papillary muscles on the sides, right ventricle in the near field, and we'll save a quick clip there and then we'll move on to an apical view. All right, from this peristernal short axis view, let's take a look at the apical view. So I'm going to go ahead and just rotate my transducer a little bit more in that clockwise motion so that my indicator is down towards the bed. And here we've got, so pause right here because I know you know how to fix this image, but this is what happened to me every time that I ever did an apical four chamber when I first started scanning, is that we've got left ventricle, right ventricle, left atrium, right atrium, but the heart's tilted on the screen and we don't have that nice vertical orientation of the heart with the septum running right down the middle. So can you show folks how to go ahead and correct that to get that vertical orientation? Sure, this is an indicator that you're a little too medial with the transducer. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to slide down towards the bed and angle back towards myself. Fantastic. And I've heard that you should be kind of aiming the butterfly beam as if it's going to hit the bottom of the right scapula. That's kind of hard for some people to imagine. So it's nice to see you do that, just tilting it down like that to get a nice vertical orientation with the heart running vertically in that view. So that's excellent. We've got both atrium, both ventricles. We can see the mitral valve nicely there, getting a bit of the tricuspid valve coming in right there. And we'll go ahead and save a quick clip here and then move on to the subcostal view. Okay. And for this one, I usually have the patients turn back on to their back. Do you do the same thing? I do, I do. So let me go ahead. So let's go ahead and do that. With a little bit more gel on my butterfly. And we're going to put the directional indicator towards the patients left in this case. So we kind of started out with it at the right shoulder, left shoulder, apical, it was pointing left, and now it's staying left. So we've done this clockwise rotation, which I think might have been a deliberate move on your part. I always do my views in that order for that reason. Okay. So here, we are just subziphered. I'm going to flip my grip here just because I find it's a little bit easier to get up and in, angling up and into the thoracic cavity. And this is a pretty common first subcostal window. We've got some bowel gas in the way, some gas in the stomach. We see a little bit of liver in the near field, but it's not the clearest view. And for me, it's a breath hold that I usually try and do as the next move here. Let's give it a try. Big breath in and hold it, please. Fantastic. And here we can see it really cleared up our view. We can see the left lobe of the liver there in the near field of the image. And then deep to that, the right side of the heart. So right ventricle there, left ventricle, tricuspid valve, right atrium, left atrium. And this is a great view looking for paracordial effusion. Most cardiac conditions can be looked at from multiple views and should be, but if you want to simplify it, the subcostal view really ideal for paracordial effusion, the apical view really ideal for comparing right ventricular to left ventricular size, and then the peristonal views for global left ventricular function as well as effusion. Absolutely. All right. Thank you so much. Let's go ahead and save one of those. Oh, you caught me. Yep. Perfect. So we've got a clip there and that's a focused cardiac ultrasound with the butterfly.

There's not a lot of free fluid present in this clip, but this is certainly suggestive of a splenic hematoma. And if we take a look at the right upper quadrant in this patient, we have the liver. We have a portion of the right kidney visible here. And we can see a fluid collection present here representing free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. And as we play this clip, we can see that this fluid extends slightly into Morrison's pouch and is present here at the inferior edge of the liver. So a good reminder that free fluid may accumulate in a quadrant distant from where the actual injury occurs, and that while the fast exam is not meant to identify a solid organ injury, in cases like this, the findings we saw on the spleen are quite suggestive of a splenic hematoma."

We're in a cardiac preset with the directional indicator oriented to the patient's right shoulder. And there's two things I wanted to point out in this view. Number one, the global left ventricular systolic function is clearly diminished. There's no real thickening of the wall in systole. There's no movement of the walls towards the center of the chamber with systole. And this is a patient with significant systolic heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy. Now the other thing that's really important to note is that our depth at 16 centimeters here is not sufficiently deep. When patients have enlarged hearts or just if we haven't paid enough attention to our depth settings, we're going to need to increase the depth significantly so that we can see not only the entire posterior wall of the left ventricle but also the left atrium which is cut off here and the descending thoracic aorta.

And we can see just grossly without measurements that the right ventricular size exceeds that of the left ventricle. There's also paradoxical septal motion here where we can see the septum bowing into the left ventricular cavity. We can also see significant right atrial enlargement. And very important to make sure that you have the probe oriented accurately so that you're not flipping the right and left sides and confusing a normal ratio for a patient with right ventricular enlargement.

And we can see some edema surrounding the wall of the gallbladder, and we can see a thickened gallbladder wall. Again, no calipers present on this image, but if we use the depth calipers or depth scale to give us a sense, it's at least five or six millimeters in thickness, and the anterior gallbladder wall should measure three millimeters or less. A good reminder that acute colosystitis often occurs when it's calculus colosystitis, the most common kind, when a stone is lodged in the neck of the gallbladder and a full sweep through the gallbladder is really important so that we're able to find the stone in the neck. If we take a look at this clip, we can see that initially the provider is scanning through and they're taking a look at the gallbladder, seeing some of the fundus here, the body, not getting a complete look at the neck of the gallbladder, and they'll change their orientation and move a little bit more laterally in just a moment and use the liver as an acoustic window, so liver here, and now we can see edema surrounding the gallbladder wall, and we're able to find that stone lodged in the neck."

Now, what I wanted to highlight in this clip as we watch it play is that the operator does an excellent job of sweeping all the way through the gallbladder. And this is a really important aspect of the technique for a gallbladder exam, because stones lodged in the neck, or all the way in the fundus, may be missed if you don't sweep through the entire structure of interest from one end to the other."
Biplane Imaging,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/17GKoNa5T1-W6AJ9IBSgfQ,Vascular Access,Biplane Imaging,Learn the best practices for utiliizing biplane imaging for needle guidance.,Michael Stone,1/20/2021,"Hi everyone, I'm Mike Stone and I'm the VP of Education and Sonography at Butterfly Network and I want to walk you through biplane imaging. So biplane imaging allows us to see a structure in two orthogonal planes simultaneously. In other words, you can see a short axis image of a structure and a long axis image at the same time to improve our confidence as to needle location during ultrasound guided needle insertions. This can be used for a variety of procedures, vascular access, whether central venous catheter or peripheral ides, arterial lines, or guiding a needle insertion during an ultrasound guided nerve block or a musculoskeletal procedure. So in traditional imaging, we're in B mode or 2D and we're used to getting a two dimensional slice of a structure and seeing it just in that plane. So if I take the IQ plus and put it onto this tissue phantom, we can see a simulated vessel, in this case, in a short axis plane. If I want to look at it in a long axis, however, I need to take off the probe, rotate it 90 degrees, and place it back down to obtain a longitudinal image of the same structure. Biplane imaging allows us to do that at the same time without having to re-manipulate the probe. And I'm going to go ahead and go into my Actions tab and I'm going to select Biplane. And what we can see here is that we're now going to have two simultaneous images on the IQ screen. And on the bottom image, we have a long view of this vessel. On the top image, we have a short axis view. Now on the bottom, the B corresponds to the blue dot on the ultrasound probe on the IQ plus. And on the top image, the butterfly icon on the left corresponds to the butterfly icon on this side of the IQ plus. So that tells me that on the top image, the butterfly icon here corresponds to the left side of the screen. And the opposite side corresponds to the yellow indicator, this bright line, on the other side of the screen. Now, Biplane is really intended for in-plane procedures. And the resolution on the bottom image is optimized for an in-plane needle insertion. And if we go ahead and look at how this appears with a needle insertion, we'll go ahead and get a good image of the vessel, the target vessel, in a long axis on the bottom. And we can see we're centered into a short axis image on the top. And as I insert the needle along the blue dot side of the probe, we can see the needle insertion beginning on the bottom image. Now the green line here, this vertical line, that corresponds to the plane at which we're seeing the short axis. So if I want to see the needle tip in short axis, I need to cross that plane. Now I may go ahead and insert all the way just to illustrate it here. You can see now we've got this bright dot here on the top of the vessel and that corresponds to the short axis image of the needle tip. If I wanted to see it sooner, I could simply slide that imaging plane closer to the needle. And now I'm able to see needle tip all the way back here. As we go ahead and complete this, let's put the plane where I anticipate intersecting the vessel. I can now direct the needle into the vessel and I can see that I'm centered very nicely in the vessel. If I had taken a less ideal approach and let's say I were off to the side, on the bottom image it still looks like I'm doing pretty well. But on the top image you can see that the needle tip is towards the left side of the screen with regards to the center of the vessel. Now I know that that side corresponds to the butterfly icon side on the IQ plus and I can simply move away from that to center it. So this is what bioplane affords us, it's a simultaneous two plane image of a structure of interest that allows us to guide our needle with precision. A couple of other things to illustrate. Lots of providers like to do ultrasound guided procedures out of plane. So let's look at what that looks like in bioplane. In this case, we now have the structure of interest in a short axis on the bottom image and in a long axis on the top image. Bioplane isn't designed for this approach, for an out of plane approach. As you can see by you could simply move the imaging plane and now you're not going to see anything of interest on the top image. But if you'd like to perform a procedure this way, make sure that the section goes directly through the structure of interest and then if we start to insert out of plane we can see the long axis or in plane image on top that the needle is approaching and on the bottom image we can see that the needle tip is within the image. So you can still get a bioplane image in this view. Although you'll notice that the top image of the longitudinal insertion is not nearly the same quality as the image that we see when we're using it as intended for an in-plane procedure. Lastly I want to illustrate that bioplane works at the same time as needle vis. So if we go ahead and go back to our actions menu and activate needle vis, we are going to get a blue highlight over the needle as it's being inserted into the tissue. And in this case it's saying insert from the left which is towards the blue dot which is facing me so I know I'm doing that correctly. And I'll go ahead and insert the needle and as I do that we can see that blue highlight over the needle on the bottom image. You can adjust the needle gain by swiping left or right on the screen. So I can decrease the needle gain, I can increase the needle gain, I can also go ahead and change the angle of insertion and in this case it's a shallow angle so 40 degrees wouldn't be ideal but 20 or 30 degrees would give me the best visualization possible on that needle as I insert. And in this case I'm able to see a really nice image of the needle highlighted in blue as it crosses the plane I can see that again in short axis on the upper image. So that's needle visualization with bioplane simultaneously and if you want to remove needle biz simply press the X and now you're back to bioplane alone and if you want to remove bioplane again press the X and you're back into a two dimensional image.

Start in a parasagital plane just off of midline with the directional indicator dot towards the patient's head. At this level we can see the sacrum as a linear hypericolic structure. As we start to slide the IQ craniily, we can appreciate the L5S1 interspace and if we continue craniily, we can identify the L4L5 interspace with anechoic fluid visualized here in the thickel sac between that L4 and L5 vertebrae. At this point, you can mark the skin in the midline of the IQ indicating the appropriate cranial cotyl level to proceed."

In this case, you're looking for a hyperacolic near-field structure with shadowing, which indicates the spinous process. Once you identify that, place a mark in the midline of the IQ corresponding to the midline of the screen. You can then slide to the adjacent spinous process and place another mark indicating midline.

First thing to be able to appreciate is bone. Bone's easy. Bone has very strong edges and so therefore ultrasound waves can't penetrate past it so you get this acoustic shadowing so you'll never see anything past bone. It's also very hyper echoic so it's really bright white. You can really tell that structure is there and then it always has kind of this similar feature. Never really change as much but then if you look up we're gonna move a little bit proximally just to pick up some of the tendons that go down into the hand. So go ahead and wiggle your fingers for me. So first of all tendons move so that's one easy way to be able to tell and then go ahead and relax for me. They also fall prey to anisotropy so we can actually use anisotropy to our benefit here by wagging the probe over and back. You're gonna see that we lose a lot of that tissue and then it shows up really nicely in field of view. Then your median nerve is what's sitting up on top here and you notice that that one doesn't really lose as much anisotropy as the rest of the tissue. Nerve does have kind of a more honeycomb pattern or a bunch of grapes pattern and you can actually scan that up and down and follow it all the way and see that it always kind of looks basically the same. So kind of right down here yeah exactly it's moving down distally for us and so there's not really much change to the structure of the nerve there. As we continue to scan up and follow that nerve we can see that we've now kind of lost our tendons and we have a muscle now. Muscle is gonna have these facial planes that runs through it. It's also going to be much more heterogeneous and a little bit more hypoacolic in terms of structure. You can also turn into a long axis view to look at that so approximately is to the left of the screen here and we can see the tendon in the middle here is very bright white, fibular, looks almost like broom bristles that have been pushed together but then the muscle tissue itself has kind of these wide spread out striations with the facial planes in between and so if you continue to scan down you can see we're running over bone, nothing's penetrating past that and so that's kind of a nice easy way to be able to differentiate between all of those tissues and that nerve structure is kind of the one that you definitely want to try to track almost more quickly when you're following it at first because it really should maintain its path without changing in terms of how big it gets or how small it gets. Fantastic. Thank you. No problem. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Medial Knee,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/M7JKYJRHTc6UIxlg1C890Q,Soft Tissue/MSK,Medial Knee,An introduction to the ultrasound evaluation of the medial knee.,Michael Stone,1/1/2020,"So medial knee injuries, MCL meniscus are super common and I'd love to see how you approach the exam of the medial knee with ultrasound. Absolutely. Alright, so I'm going to put the leg into a little bit of external rotation here. We're going to start in long axis view and just fall onto the joint line. If you can't find it, palpate it first, but here we have it quite nicely. So we have the femoral condyle, T-bial plateau, and then right in between is actually our medial meniscus. So it looks like this nice little pizza pie or triangular structure. You can't see all of it when you look at it, but you can see the outermost fibers so you can look for any tearing or striations within the tissue. And then you'll notice up over top of it here, that's actually your MCL. So we're going to follow that up proximally, adjusting as needed, up to the actual femoral condyle where it originates from. Then we're going to follow it down distally. All the way down, past our pheas and serine tendons, which is your sacriole before T. So that's your sartorius, chrysalis, and semi-tendenosis tendons. And that is a potential point of bursopathy. And so that can be a point to inject if needed. We're going to keep moving past that though and follow that MCL all the way down. And you'll notice that MCL really travels quite far distally and inserts down here on the tibia. So really make sure that you are scanning all the way down to actually take a look at this fully. And then when we come back up to the joint line, we can rotate on that tendon as well and try to follow it even in short axis if we needed to down distally. The only other thing that I think is really important to see here is going to be our MPFL. So that's just part of your retinaculum. It's just a thickened portion. So we're going to get the patellar tendon, which is on the right side here. And we're going to see this retinaculum here that's simply traveling between the actual condyle and the patella itself. And that just helps hold the kneecap in place. So if people rupture it, for example, with ACL injury, sometimes that's something that they'd want to fix as well. So that's something else we can appreciate. Lastly, maybe we could do a stress test. I'm going to have you actually hold the probe. And then I'm going to stress the knee. So I'm going to put the probe over the joint line there. Great. And then all you're going to want to do is actually put a valgus stress from the lateral hand or this outside hand and then just holding the ankle in place or putting a little bit of a various stress on that. And so I'm trying to open up that joint space. And you can see I'm clearly stressing the joint space and nothing is really moving, which means he has a nice, strong ACL. All right. Fantastic. Thanks so much. No problem. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Lateral Shoulder,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/LFTbc9HyTK2bxTcM-19Xgw,Soft Tissue/MSK,Lateral Shoulder,"An introduction to the ultrasound evaluation of the lateral shoulder, including the supraspinatus tendon and subacromial subdeltoid bursa.",Michael Stone,1/1/2020,So I'm looking forward to this because I feel like this is where I see most of the pathology when I look at shoulders in the lateral portion so walk me through your approach. Absolutely yeah if there's one area you're going to know know how to do this one. So first thing I'll do is we'll go back to that spine of the scapula that's an easy point to find here and then we'll take a look here and we're going to basically follow that out and you're gonna end up hitting the acromion here and you're not going to see anything below it and that's normal that's acoustic shadowing that's expected you can't penetrate through bone with ultrasound but as we come past that we're gonna see tissue again and so this is gonna be the deltoid over top and then this is actually your super spinatus down below. Now in order to get a better view of that super spinatus we like to move the patient into what's called the modified crass position so they're just gonna take their hand and put it back in their pocket okay and keeping their arms kind of forward like that yep perfect. Alright and now that's gonna actually let us take a really nice look at that super spinatus and going to let it extend out from below the acromion as much as we can possibly see. So again acromion there in view follow it out laterally here's our super spinatus and we can follow that down to the attachment point. Now if we go back up here we're gonna scan both anteriorly and posteriorly in this long axis view so that we can see the entire length of the super spinatus make sure there's not some irregularities or some tearing noted. We can also take a look at this subdeltoid or subochromial bursa so basically this anechoic line that we see here it's a potential space it's a versatile space some people you'll see it some people won't have any fluid in it so it's a little bit harder to appreciate. This model does indeed have a little bit of fluid in his bursa and so this is that a bursal space. So if we wanted to do a subdeltoid bursa injection this is our positioning that we could use sometimes I'll have the patient laying supine with 30 degrees of elevation of the head of the bed as well but this is another way you could certainly do it and basically you're going to come in from the right side of the screen and inject into this bursal space so you can kind of see me pushing on the skin there and so that's where the needle would be trekking through. Sure taking like an in-plane approach you can see the whole needle is a small target. Follow the needle yeah exactly and this that's why ultrasound so great is I can make sure I'm actually in the bursa and not injecting steroid into the tendon which we know is not great for tendon health. So now we can also take a look for impingement so there's multiple reasons somebody can have impingement at this point. Osteoarthritis having some sort of low-lying acromion can also do it or else having like calcific tendonitis which we might see in a little bit younger population with the calcium deposits in the tendon and so what we're gonna do there is I'm gonna try to just kind of stay on the tendon while it runs under the acromion and I'm gonna have the patient just abduct their arm back and forth and see that nice movement underneath the tissue plane there and so he's not having any issues it's not clicking it's not buckling it's not hurting him he can move all the way through so that looks totally normal you can stop moving there. The last thing we're gonna do now is just turn on to this in short axis view so I'm gonna rotate the transducer again contact sport two hands and I'm going to scan posteriorly and this is going to be the interval between the infra spinnatus and the super spinnatus and then I can scan towards the anterior aspect and I'm actually going to be able to see that oblique structure again which is our long head of our biceps so we're back at kind of that place where we began of the rotator cuff interval and so there you go super spinnatus and then biceps tendon and so we can actually look at the length of that tendon in short axis view as well make sure it looks healthy and there's no tearing and no pathology to be appreciated full circle full circle all right thank you so much [BLANK_AUDIO]
Posterior Shoulder,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/1zgEYlVuSUmRYTHnySFaWA,Soft Tissue/MSK,Posterior Shoulder,"An introduction to the ultrasound evaluation of the posterior shoulder, including the glenohumeral joint and spinoscapular notch.",Michael Stone,1/1/2020,"All right, so walk me through the posterior shoulder. Okay, so we've moved our patient into a lateral to cubitist position or a side-lying view. This just makes it a lot easier to see all these posterior structures. Main thing you wanna make sure is that they have their arm kind of resting on their side or on their hip. It just kind of holds them in one position so that they don't keep moving it around. Gives you a little bit better control over what you're looking at as well. First thing we like to do is just take a look at that posterior shoulder joint. So going to put the ultrasound probe down and we should see this kind of curved structure here and that is the posterior side of the humeral head. And then the other bony landmark we see right here, this other little tiny ski slope is gonna be your glenoid. In between those two structures is, of course, the labrum. This is the posterior aspect of the labrum. You cannot see the entire thing on ultrasound. It is unfortunately one of the pitfalls. However, you can quite nicely make out some of that articular cartilage as well. And you can also look for bony irregularity kind of a long layer if you can scan along the bone. It's pretty normal to see a little bit of bony irregularity so don't get too excited there. But if something looks drastically different, especially if you compare it to the other side, obviously you should be concerned about pathology. One thing we can also do here is this would be the setup for a posterior glenoid or glenoid humeral joint injection. So I would actually be standing on your side and I'd follow my needle in from this aspect and actually come over top of the humeral head into this glenoid space here, making sure not to hit the labrum. So you should get really nice flow if you're having trouble actually injecting. It's probably 'cause you're in the labrum. If they yell out, 'cause you're in the labrum. - You're in the labrum. - So don't go in there. From there we're also gonna look at the spano glenoid notch. And so I'm just going to go just past the glenoid there and you can already see that vasculature structure here. So the notch is here in order to make it look a little bit brighter, a little bit more prominent. You can actually take the midline side of the ultrasound probe and just turn it towards the head just ever so slightly to get kind of a deeper view of the actual notch. And you can see the artery pulsing. We don't even have to turn Doppler on in order to see that. And then the super scapular nerve is actually right there beside it. So it's a nice structure to be able to see. One other quick note is if the patient goes into external rotation here, you might see some venous engorgement. So see how much bigger the blood vessels can look there. And so some people might mistake that for actually assist and it's not. And so just be aware that that can happen just so that you're not surprised. So again, having the patient with their arm always in one position makes it a lot easier to maneuver. From there, we're gonna look at the infraspinatus. And so this is one of the rotator cuff muscles obviously. It's got a really nice big central slip. So the musculature we can see here as we follow along that central slip comes and inserts onto the actual humors and then meets up with the super spinnatus over here. We'll come back over here to this backside and we can look at the tendon in short axis view as well. And so we can see the muscle here with the central tendon slip. And then as we move laterally to its insertion point, we're gonna see it turn into basically all tendon. If we come back out to where the myotendinous junction is and scan a little bit distally, we're gonna see the terries minor. So you can see a whole other muscle here with another tendon slip. That's gonna be your terries minor. The terries minor is very rarely injured in rotator cuff injuries. And so it's a nice comparison view for you to be able to say, okay, if that's what normal looks like, what is my infraspinatus look like? If the infraspinatus looks really white or looks kind of all like tendon, it's probably fatty infiltrate. If you don't see muscle at all, you might have a ruptured tendon. And so that's just worth looking at. We can follow that back in towards the insertion here. And then we can see that terries minor tendon insertion. And I'm gonna rotate on that now to look at it in long axis. This tendon's really slim, really skinny tendon. And so because of it, it's pretty hard to find if you just throw the ultrasound probe onto the patient. And so this is a nice way to view it there. There's a great view of it here, okay? But it's much skinnier than the infraspinatus is. So I usually recommend finding in short axis and then rotate onto it. - So find an in short, track it up to insertion, rotate. - Correct, exactly. Follow it back up. And then if we scan upwards, we're gonna hit the infraspinatus right there. And so that tendon's obviously much easier to find. At this point, we can also look at the super scapular notch, which is the other place, the super scapular nerve runs through. So we're gonna find the spine of the scapula. And it's, so this is the spine of the scapula. It's very bright white structure. And there's this one little divot right here that we're gonna see. And so that right there is the actual notch. And you can see the transversal ligament running on top of it. And sometimes we can actually see the artery pulsing there too. So we can try to put doppler on, see if it shows up. This is a very small artery. So sometimes you won't see it. (silence) There it is. So we're gonna hit that. Don't hit that when you're doing an injection. And this is a nice nerve block that you can do for adhesive capsulatus or frozen shoulder. So a lot of times I'll actually come in from this medial approach. So I usually have the patient sitting up for this one. And I'll come in, aim past the artery and short of the artery and the nerve is right beside it. You can't actually see the nerve particularly well. - It's trying to lift it out of the notch. - Correct, exactly. Give it a little bit of space more than anything else. And then that is the main portion of this posterior shoulder. - Thank you so much. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Knee Extensor Mechanism,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/oP6wREdXTTGltGhLUQTzoQ,Soft Tissue/MSK,Knee Extensor Mechanism,An introduction to the ultrasound evaluation of the extensor mechanism of the knee.,Michael Stone,1/1/2020,"So it'd be great to see how you approach the extensor mechanism exam and I guess let's start with the proximal extensor mechanism by the quad tendon. Okay, sounds good. So make sure you have a bolster underneath the leg just to give you a little bit of tension of that extensor mechanism. And I usually start in short axis view looking at that quadricep tendon. So one thing to keep in mind here is there's multiple layers of this tendon and of course there's multiple muscles that add into it. So I'm going to actually scan approximately to try to appreciate where that myotendent dysfunction occurs. So we have the rectus femoris up top. We have the vastus intermedius down below. We have the femur right here. Then if you scan laterally you're gonna see the vastus lateralis. Scan medially you're gonna see the vastus medialis. Come back to center. Okay, so now you know where all your anatomy is. As I start to scan distally I'm gonna lose rectus femoris first. Then you're going to lose slips of the vastus lateralis and medialis into that central portion. And then you're gonna lose the vastus intermedius last. And as you continue to scan down make sure that you're maneuvering the probe appropriately and kind of wagging or tilting as necessary to keep that tendon in view because otherwise this could certainly be an area that falls prey to an isotropy like we see right there. So if I wag and tilt I get everything in view much better. I can follow that all the way up to the patella itself. Now if I were to go into a long axis view looking at this tissue plane. I'll rotate on that space. I'm gonna see the patella here in my picture. And then we're gonna see the quadriceps tendon right over top here. And I can scan all the way medial and all the way lateral to take a look at that tissue. We might see a little bit of tendinopathy within that tissue. Pretty common. But nothing that looks like a large tear or anything like that. As I continue to scan proximally here we are gonna see a few other structures. This is your quadriceps versa or excuse me quadriceps fat pad which falls right underneath the quadriceps tendon. And then you have your super patellar recess or super patellar space which is actually a space that joins the knee joint. And so that's a space that you can actually inject into or aspirate fluid out of as necessary. And then just deep to that you're actually gonna have the pre-femoral fat pad. So here's the femur down in the bottom of the image here. This very bright white line. And sitting right over top of that is the fat pad. Now as we scan distally to come up over the patella. I'm just gonna get myself a little bit more gel. Scan distally up over the patella. And you're gonna have to use very light pressure here which is why I did give myself quite a bit of gel to use. And we're gonna look for a potential joint space or patellar bristle space in here. And so basically that very slight anechoic line. Not this dark really dark large line that's supposed to be there. But this tiny space right above it that's what we're actually seeing. And that's the space that's technically the pre-patellar bristle. Very uncommon to see fluid in there. However people that are on their knees a lot for work or from washing floors or anything like that they can sometimes get fluid into that space. Got some more of a potential space unless there's pathology there. Correct exactly. Otherwise you shouldn't really be able to see it. Just make sure you're not pushing down so hard that you squeeze the fluid out of it. Makes sense. Yep. Alright thanks so much. Yep."
Lateral Knee,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/7OVDESsuTb6ImY9YdiAakQ,Soft Tissue/MSK,Lateral Knee,An introduction to the ultrasound evaluation of the lateral knee.,Michael Stone,1/1/2020,"So, walk me through your approach to the lateral knee, the IT band, LCL, meniscus. Okay. Now, let's start with the IT band. So it is definitely one of the thicker structures that we're going to see out here. One really good way to actually look at it is to start at the patellar tendon and work our way laterally because it'll be the next thing that we run into. So I'm just going to place this. So right now the left side of the screen is proximal and I'm going to scan out laterally. And the next big fibular structure I see as we get towards Gertie's tubercle is the IT band. So we can kind of see that right there. And so now I'm going to follow that up proximally. And following these fibers up, up, up, up, up, up, as we get to this thickening that runs over the vastest lateralis. So we can really appreciate that quite nicely there. I'm going to now rotate into short axis view. So now anterior is on the left of the screen. And if we follow it down, again, we can see this nice thickened tissue moving to the posterior side of it, we can really appreciate how much thicker it is. You can get a bursitis at the IT band kind of at this location as it runs over the femoral condyle. And so there is this little potential space there. And so if there is fluid in there with that anechoic line, that is sometimes a place that we would do an injection to help with some discomfort. Okay. As we scan down further, we're going to pass the joint line right there. And at that point, that's where we would head down to Gertie's tubercle. What I'm going to do instead though is rotate on that space just to look at the actual lateral joint line. And so we're going to see a couple of structures here. We see the femoral condyle again. We see the tibia. And we see that lateral meniscus, that little pie-shaped structure. Again, we can only see kind of the outermost fibers of it. However, we can take a look at that just to make sure there's no dysfunction or there's no pathology there. If I scan up here, we also see a little circular structure right there. And that's actually the short axis view of the poplidius, which is a structure that we don't scan all that often. However, if somebody is complaining of posterior knee pain or snapping knee pain, that is something that you can scan further on the posterior exam. Then the only other structure that we really want to pay attention to here is actually your lateral collateral ligament or your fibular collateral ligament. And it looks pretty rope-like. So I'm going to go back into short axis here to try to pick it up there. There we go. And I'm going to follow it down to where it inserts here on the fibular head. So you can kind of see it inserting here on the fibular head. And if I scan back up proximally, I can follow that all the way up to the femoral condyle. And we can look at it also in short axis view. There we go. So we see that nice fibular structure. We can scan with it all the way down back to the fibula. There we go. So let's just follow it all the way back up there. You're having a little bit of loss of contact here just because we don't have too much gel. So just add a little more to be able to follow that the rest of the way. Don't be afraid if you need to add gel part way through your scan to make sure that you can follow that tissue all the way up to that condyle. There we go. I love that picture. The last thing we'll want to do is maybe a quick varistress testing. Maybe I'll have you stress test. And I'll just try to stay onto the space here. Lift your knee a little. Perfect. And yep, you're just going to try to gap that space open. And we're not seeing any give there. And so that's great. Because we have a nice strong lateral collateral ligament. All right. Thank you. Yep. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Baker's Cyst,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/8r-08bAxTJWM971SYWl74g,Soft Tissue/MSK,Baker's Cyst,The ultrasound approach to the evaluation of a suspected Baker's cyst.,Michael Stone,1/1/2020,"So we see patients with calf pain pretty commonly and we worry about DVT but we can also use ultrasound to look at bakersists And I'd love to see how you approach doing that. Sure So make sure you know your anatomy really well for this one. You want to make sure that the patient is laying prone With their leg either hanging off the bed a little bit or at least with their knee extended and then I like to start With a short axis view and you want to pick up the semi-membranosis So basically you're looking for a large muscle and then tendon junction Semi-tendinosis is that really? superficial tendon way up there so we don't want that one so it's the other one and We're gonna scan down to a point where we actually see the medial gastrocnemius come into the picture as well a bakersist is a fluid collection that comes from the posterior knee joint and pops through a potential space between the medial Gastroc and the semi-membranosis the medial gastroc is actually the lateral border of it and the semi-membranosis ends up becoming the medial border because of that yin yin kind of shape So if we scan down, we're gonna just be looking for that tendon right there Okay, and then if I drop off of that, I'm gonna lose it a little bit and that's anisotropy. So That's just something to be aware of and it's just because the two tendons are crisscrossing over each other And so we're gonna look for that comma shape that we would expect to see right there and That's how we're gonna be able to tell where a bakersist would be showing up. So what's our take home point here? Basically if you are scanning and you see fluid coming from that potential space between the medial gastroc and the semi-membranosis at that point where we see that comma and the two tendons crossing each other then it's probably a bakersist it's worth It's considering aspiration if it's causing the patient pain If you see fluid somewhere else in the posterior knee or you see a pulsatile mass or you put color doppler on and it's clearly got blood flow in it Do not aspirate this needs further testing because it's not a bakersist makes sense. All right. Thanks so much. No problem [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Anterior Shoulder Part 2,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/9W3aeL8pSh2NmFjqdWUXvg,Soft Tissue/MSK,Anterior Shoulder Part 2,"Dynamic imaging of the biceps tendon, and evaluation of the subscapularis tendon and acromioclavicular joint.",Michael Stone,1/1/2020,"Okay, so we've looked at the biceps tendon in short axis. We've looked at the rotator cuff interval and the PEC major Let's continue with the anterior shoulder. Absolutely. So one other good thing to take a look at in this position is Look for a snapping shoulder. A lot of patients will sometimes complain about oh My shoulder makes this weird noise or it snaps or it catches and so looking at the biceps tendon to see if it's Kind of subluxing in and out of the groove is sometimes a really helpful thing to do. So what we'll do is We'll bring the arm up into a little bit of elbow flexion and then have the patient basically internally and externally Rotate their shoulder putting very light transducer pressure down if I push too hard I'm gonna hold that tendon in the sheath even if it is subluxing So we're gonna just slowly kind of move through that internal and external rotation for me great. Thank you We're gonna try to stay on that guy There you go, and so he is obviously not subluxing, but this is where we would see it if it was happening We're gonna then put him into that external rotation there and I'm gonna follow this tendon in right here and come to basically the core-coid process and So this is this bony landmark here and so this tendon here is now our subscapularis it comes and wraps around and inserts on to the lesser tubercle and Then we can also appreciate for any bursitis within this space as well So you have a kind of impingement under the core-coid exactly exactly so We can just have him keep doing that and take a look and if we really push him into a little bit more external rotation He doesn't quite have the range of motion to like this very much But we can see a little bit of the actual Oskilature showing up there as well. The one other thing that's really important with the supers or the subscapularis Is that when we turn on it in short axis you have to be aware of the fact that this tendon Typically has all these little slips and so it almost looks like these little finger-like projections. That is normal Those are not tears in the tendon and so you just have to be careful that you don't get too excited about calling that Injury or irregularity when it's in fact completely normal From there will also look at the long head of the biceps in long axis view. So we'll just rotate on it in that interval Scan distally with it and you can follow it all the way down to that myotendentous junction And then we can also follow it up as we follow it Proximally it is going to wrap around a little bit and so you're going to have to kind of Maneuver the ultrasound probe so that you can kind of keep it in view. So again, this is where that contact sport Saying comes into play and we can follow that in towards the glenoid itself The last thing we're going to take a look at here is the acromioclavicular joint So if you have a hard time seeing it if you have a patient who's really bulky Help aid it find it first with your fingers So it at least gives you an idea of where you're going and then you simply place the probe down on it You can get rid of some of the steps now and we'll see via chromium is on the left of the screen and the clavicle is on the right of the screen Great thing we can look for here is distal clavicle osteolysis and our younger patients Or else just good old osteoarthritis and some of our older patients and you can also look at the actual capsule itself This is a great way to do an AC joint injection as well you can either use the short axis view and kind of help it your way down and You'll see just the needle tip. Otherwise you can rotate on it and find the acromian scan midline find the clavicle pull back again and Basically you're aiming for this space in between the two and so I would do an AC joint injection like this That's how you can guarantee you get it in the right spot and you have no risk of hitting the lungs Always a great thing. All right. Thank you so much >> Yeah. (erasurement commissioned note)"
Anterior Shoulder Part 1,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/3yJkooYZTQK4oGcI4jtm4Q,Soft Tissue/MSK,Anterior Shoulder Part 1,The initial approach to evaluating the anterior shoulder including biceps tendon and rotator interval.,Michael Stone,1/1/2020,"Okay so we have our patient supine we're in an MSK preset let's get into the anterior shoulder. Okay sounds good. So main thing I like to do is make sure that my marker is making sense to me. I like to look at everyone anatomically and so what makes the most sense for me is if it's pointed lateral or pointed to my left regardless of which way I'm scanning the patient. Anytime I move my hand to the left that's the part of the musculature I see anytime I move my hand to the right that's the part of the musculature I see so that makes the most sense to me do what makes the most sense to you. The other thing with the anterior shoulder especially when we're looking at the biceps tendon we want to make sure that their arms in a little bit of supination so that that shoulder is externally rotated and ultrasound is a contact sport so make sure you have enough gel and make sure that your hand is actually in contact with the patient that's the best way to get a good scan. So when we're here first thing we're going to do is kind of find our home base our home base in this situation is the actual short or long head of the biceps in short axis so we're going to see it in the actual bicipital groove here and we can actually follow it down distally and we're going to lose it a little bit here as it runs underneath the pectoralis major tendon which we see right here in the image. Once we move past that we're going to get into biceps muscle so that's the myotendenous junction there. Then if we come back up approximately we'll get back into that biceps tendon and we're going to follow it along until we hit into this point where it looks a little bit more oblong in structure and that's at the point of the rotator cuff interval. So basically we're seeing the biceps tendon as it's wrapping over and we're going to see the subscapularis excuse me here and then you're going to see the super spinnatus on the back side of it. So that's a nice way to take a look at those structures there. The last thing we want to do, this is important for when you're doing any sort of injection for the biceps tendon sheath. You need to make sure to turn on color doppler to make sure that there's no blood vessels in the area because usually when we do a sheath injection we're doing it here within the groove and what we want to make sure is that there isn't an important blood vessel that we're going to accidentally hit on our way into the sheath. So I can scan here, make sure there's no blood vessels there that I'm worried about and things look pretty good so this would be an appropriate trajectory to take. Great, thank you so much.

In addition we can see the needle here being inserted in an in-plane approach and as the needle is advanced the operator visualizes the needle tip, places it adjacent to the radial nerve, aspirates and injects local anesthetic at this site. As local anesthetic is being injected, anechoic fluid can be seen to spread around the nerve and as the needle is visualized and repositioned superficially to the nerve here anesthetic starts to outline the nerve itself and the procedure is continued with continued administration of anesthesia deep to the nerve and the needle tip is advanced here fully surrounding the nerve with local anesthetic."

I'm an emergency physician and point of care ultrasound specialist and I'm going to show you how to identify the important landmarks anatomically and based on ultrasound for performing an ultrasound guided erector spinae plane block or ESP block using the IQ. The ESP block is a relatively new block in regional anesthesia. It provides a large territory of sensory block to the chest wall and in the emergency department we're using it predominantly for control of pain in patients with multiple rib fractures. In this case we're positioned prone. The block can be performed with the patient sitting upright or in a lateral decubitus. You're going to identify the approximate T5 level between the scapula, use a musculoskeletal preset because we're not really looking for individual nerves in this case. We're really looking for bones and muscles and we're going to put the IQ on with the indicator towards the patient's head in a parasaginal plane just over the middle of the scapula, interscapula region just to the midline of the scapula. When we put the transducer on we're going to see rib and shadow and pleura just like we do for a pneumothorax exam. From here we'll slide the transducer immediately following the ribs until the ribs turn into the transverse process and at this level we're able to look at the transverse process there in the middle of the screen just deep to the erector spina muscle and the transducer will be held in this orientation with the non-dominant hand and with the dominant hand a needle will be inserted from the cephalat aspect of the probe in plane. It'll come down in this case from the left of the screen, land gently onto the transverse process and inject a large volume 20 to 30 mLs of anesthetic solution to dissect the erector spina muscle off of the transverse process and this will spread throughout the ESP, the erector spina plane and will provide a large territory of sensory analgesia for the patient with multiple rib fractures. So that's the procedure for identifying the relevant anatomy and injection site for an ESP block using the IQ. Thank you. [BLANK_AUDIO]"

I'm an emergency physician and a point of care ultrasound specialist. I'm going to show you how to identify peripheral veins in the upper extremity for patients with challenging IV access using the IQ. First things first, we'll look at the bacilic vein. We're going to look at the medial upper arm just above the elbow. The bacilic vein is right in the center of the screen here, anechoic, compressible. There's no adjacent artery for the bacilic vein, which makes it a very attractive target for IV placement. You can identify it and cannulate it in a short axis like this, or you could turn and cannulate it in a long axis. If you wanted to use color to help confirm that you're looking at the vein, you could use color and make sure that you've got good flow within the vein. Or you could just use B-mode features like compressibility to identify that you're looking at the vein. An alternative approach would be the cephalic vein on the other side of the arm, still in a transverse orientation, very superficial above the muscle. And here you can see the cephalic vein in the near field, compressible. You can follow it up and find a location where it runs in a straight line. It doesn't really turn much from left to right on the screen as you scan up and down and use that as an appropriate target for IV placement. A few of those approaches can help find a good IV in the upper arm using the IQ. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Approach to Dyspnea,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/l9JrTUW8QcCMHIYtoBXWQA,Cardiac,Approach to Dyspnea,An approach to the undifferentiated dyspneic patient.,Michael Stone,7/29/2019,"I'm Mike Stone and I'm an emergency physician and a point of care ultrasound specialist and I'm going to show you how to assess a patient with shortness of breath or dyspnea using the IQ. Typically, looking at a patient who's short of breath with ultrasound will include an assessment of the heart, the lungs, and potentially the lower extremity veins. With a traditional ultrasound system that involves switching to two or three different transducers and we're going to show how quickly and easily you can assess a patient looking at the heart, the lungs, and the lower extremity veins using just the IQ. So to start, we'll pick a cardiac preset. We'll get peristernal views first and we'll put the transducer just to the left of the sternum with the indicator up towards the patient's right shoulder and we'll end up with a peristernal long axis view here where we're able to assess for pericardial fluid. We're able to look at global LV contractility and we're able to get a general sense of RV and LV ratios to look for RV strain or enlargement. We can then rotate the transducer to the patient's left shoulder and get a peristernal short axis view, in this case mid ventricular view at the level of the papillary muscles looking for LV contractility for pericardial fluid or for flattening of the interventricular septum or signs of RV enlargement. So here we'll place the transducer with the indicator towards the bed just under the nipple in the anterior axillary line looking for an apical four chamber view. And this view can really be optimized if the patient's rolled into a de-cubitous position but for a patient who's short of breath, it's often really challenging to get that patient to lay down on their side right away as their short of breath. So sometimes this can be a limited view but in this case we're able to look at LV and RV ratios and see that the LV is bigger than the RV which is normal and what we're anticipating. We'll move on to a subcostal view so indicator to the patient's left just under the zifeway process and we're looking for fluids surrounding the heart. We're looking for any signs of LV or RV dysfunction from this view as well. And from this view, if we place the indicator towards the ceiling or towards the patient's head, we're also able to get a look at the vena cava and in this case we can see that it's flattening with respiration. There's no plethora to the vena cava or failure of it to collapse with respiration which could indicate an obstructive cause of shock like pulmonary embolism or heart failure. We'll then move on to the lungs and traditionally we'd be changing transducers at this stage but here we can just go to the lung preset, take a look in the peristurnal windows and assess for pneumothorax with lung sliding, look for A lines versus B lines which could indicate clear lungs versus congested lungs or fluid filled lungs. And in this case we have an A line pattern which is normal with normal lung sliding. We'll place the transducer similarly on the left chest and get the same view of normal lung sliding in A lines. A little bit more lateral on the chest wall on the left so that we can avoid the heart for another view of lung sliding in A lines showing no B lines. And in this case we've really seen no cause for this patient's shortness of breath. We may consider in the right clinical context if we're worried about pulmonary embolism just moving down to the legs to take a look for proximal deep venous thrombosis which would be an indirect confirmation of pulmonary embolism. And again instead of changing transducers we'll just move on to a vascular deep vein preset, we'll come down to the leg and we'll start off in the femoral vein with the indicator to the patient's right. We'll identify the femoral vein, in this case the common femoral vein, compressing it, sliding down the leg and following the common femoral vein, compressing as we go. And I would typically follow all the way to the knee. In this case we'll abbreviate the exam and show the palpatil exam which would follow the full course of the femoral vein. So a posterior approach here, we identify the palpatil vein, it's compressible, we'll follow the palpatil vein down until it trifurcates. So that's an evaluation of a patient with shortness of breath or dyspnea using the IQ. Thank you. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Approach to the eFAST Exam,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/Iv64u_BeTtqZjPfF0Ufhow,FAST,Approach to the eFAST Exam,An introduction to evaluating trauma patients with the eFAST exam.,Michael Stone,7/29/2019,"I'm Mike Stone. I'm an emergency physician and a point of care ultrasound specialist. And I'm going to show you how to perform an extended fast exam with the IQ. In trauma patients, we're concerned about hemorrhage, and we're concerned about hemorrhage in the abdominal cavity, into the thoracic cavity, into the pericardial sac surrounding the heart, or lung collapse, or pneumothorax. Traditionally, assessing the abdominal cavity, the pericardial space and the lung involve switching between three different transducers. And I'm going to show you how with the IQ, you're able to evaluate all of those spaces with a single transducer very rapidly. So we'll start off with the abdominal preset, and we'll look in Morrison's pouch. We identify the liver, the kidney. We look in Morrison's for any free fluid. We slide up and look above the diaphragm for any fluid in the thoracic cavity. We then move on to the left upper quadrant. We identify the spleen. We look for fluid in the peri-spelenic area, out by the spelenic tip, down in the spelenor renal recess, and above the diaphragm for any thoracic fluid that could indicate a hemothorax on the left. Then we'll move on to the pelvis, and take a look at the bladder, fanning left and right to look for any fluid in the pelvis behind the bladder, or deep to the bladder. We'll then switch to a cardiac preset, and take a look from a subcostal window, and look for any fluid around the heart. And finding no pericardial fluid, we'll move on and take a look at the lungs by switching to a lung preset, and applying the IQ with the indicator towards his head in the right peristernal space, identifying the pleural line and lung sliding, looking at several inner spaces, moving on to the left, identifying lung sliding on the left, and that's the extended fast exam using the IQ.

Evaluation for Pneumothorax,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/nZ_aMGr2RNKlvHVqnT4QIg,Pulmonary,Evaluation for Pneumothorax,How to use ultrasound to evaluate for pneumothorax,Michael Stone,7/29/2019,"Hi, I'm Mike Stone. I'm an emergency physician and a point of care ultrasound specialist. And I'm going to be showing you how to evaluate for pneumothorax using the IQ. We commonly see patients in the emergency department with chest pain, whether it's traumatic or non-traumatic, patients with asthma or COPD who develop sudden onset unilateral chest pain or shortness of breath, or patients on a ventilator who have decompensated and are difficult to bag or difficult to oxygenate. In all of those cases, we worry about the presence of a pneumothorax or a collapsed lung, and ultrasound is a fantastic modality to allow us to assess for this disease entity at the bedside in real time with extremely high accuracy. So what we'll do is we'll select a lung preset and we'll go ahead and take the IQ and apply it in a peristurnal orientation with the indicator up towards the patient's head. When we do that, we're going to land on rib and we'll see that hyperacolic line with shadowing deep to it indicating that we're looking at the bony cortex of a rib. And just below the rib, we get a horizontal hyperacolic or bright line that's sliding left and right on the screen that represents the two layers of the pleura, the visceral and parietal pleura sliding against each other. When they slide against each other, there's no air interposed between the two layers and we can feel confident that there's no pneumothorax present at the site we're evaluating. Now, a couple of tips. If you're having a hard time seeing lung sliding or pleura sliding, you can go ahead and decrease the depth by swiping down, decrease the gain by swiping left, and those two tips may accentuate the sliding a little bit to make it easier to notice and easier to make a diagnostic decision. The assessment for pneumothorax won't just take place at one interspace. You'll want to evaluate multiple interspaces to see if there's lung sliding present throughout the chest wall and throughout the hemithorax. If you're concerned about both sides, clearly you'll want to evaluate both sides. And that's how you evaluate for the presence of pneumothorax using the IQ. Thank you. [BLANK_AUDIO]"

I'm a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist and an intensivist and also a point of care ultrasound specialist. And one of the scenarios that I have found myself in and I think anyone who's in the medical field has been and before is that of a patient and cardiac arrest. You're running into a room to try to help the patient recover cardiac function. There are tons of people there. Chest compressions are underway and you're trying to figure out exactly why this happened. So there is a protocol actually called Focused Echocardiographic Evaluation and Life Support that incorporates a point of care device such as the butterfly into the CPR scenario. And what you do basically is while chest compressions are underway on the patient, you're getting your probe and your screen ready. You're going to increase basically the depth on the screen because you know you're going to place the probe in the subcostal view with the orientation marker to about 230. And while chest compressions are underway, you're trying to optimize your view. You know it's going to be bouncing around because of the chest compressions, but that's okay. And when the team basically gets to the 10 second pause where they're going to check the pulse, they're going to start counting down. And during the pulse check, you are going to press the record button and just record whatever image it is that you are acquiring. As they approach the end of the 10 second pulse check, they're going to say 9, 10 resume chest compressions, you hit stop, step away from the patient, and then can go back to the images that you have acquired to look at what's going on with the heart. Is this patient in cardiac arrest because the heart is under filled, the LV is under filled and they need volume or blood? Is the RV big and dilated? Is there a clot in the right atrium? Does this be a pulmonary embolism? Is there a fluid surrounding the heart? Is this a tamponade that you could do something about in order to recover the patient's hemodynamic capabilities? And that is kind of the beauty of the butterfly. You're bringing it into an area that's completely packed when chest compressions are happening. It's portable, it's small. You can get right in there and narrow down your differential diagnosis to help the patient recover hemodynamic outcomes. And that's basically how I use the butterfly IQ when I'm in code scenarios.

Evaluation for Cardiomyopathy,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/0g6AvelVR9C0NUbrL_tQTw,Cardiac,Evaluation for Cardiomyopathy,How to perform a focused cardiac ultrasound to evaluate for cardiomyopathy.,Michael Stone,7/29/2019,"Hi, I'm Dr. Sarnick Rivon. I'm a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist, an intensivist, and also a point-of-care ultrasound specialist. And when I'm taking care of patients in the ICU or in the operating room, I'm trying to figure out often times why they're hypotensive. A lot of our patients have cardiomyopathy and there are different kinds of cardiomyopathy, whether it's septic, cardiomyopathy, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, and we have to be able to support their cardiac function in order for them to recover. So what I'll usually do is I'll start by going to the presets and selecting the cardiac preset. And once I'm in the cardiac preset, I'm going to take the probe and put it in the third to fourth intercostal space with the orientation marker pointed towards the patient's right shoulder. This is going to give me the peristonal long access view and that is a really nice view for evaluation of the basilar portions of the left ventricle as well as the mid portions of the left ventricle. You shouldn't and can't see the apex in this view. You can also see the RV at the very top of the image and what you're looking for is to see if the heart is thickening, if the walls are approximating each other, and the contractility looks good. If you think you see a contractility that's impaired, then you're going to want to proceed by going to look at the peristonal short access view by rotating the probe orientation marker towards the patient's left shoulder. And once you're here at the left shoulder, you can start to scan down the heart. You're going to scan down down down the heart until you get kind of to the mid portions of the left ventricle where you have the mid papillary view of the left ventricle. And you're looking for a thickening and approximation of the walls of the LV. In addition, you're going to look at the right ventricle to make sure that the right ventricle doesn't look big and dilated because cardiomyopathy can affect either the left or the right side. And from here you're going to scan down even further and you're going to want to look at the apex of the heart. And when you're at the apex, you're looking for contractility here as well because certain patients who have stress-induced cardiomyopathy develop tauquetsubos cardiomyopathy, which is a cardiomyopathy that basically spares that causes ballooning of the apex. And the heart kind of looks like an octopus. A trap, that's where it gets the name, is tauquetsubos, is octopus trap in Japanese. So you're looking to see what the apex is doing. And if you see the apex is not contracting very well and there's no other reason why that should be going on, then you want to consider tauquetsubos cardiomyopathy as the etiology of the patient's shock. And in just a couple of seconds, you have looked through the entire heart and determined how the heart is beating and then you can direct care appropriately. And that's how I use the butterfly IQ when I'm in the IC or the OR to try to treat my patients who are in shock. >> Okay."
Ultrasound in the Septic Patient,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/xSuEPEziTcur9AbKQnSxFw,Cardiac,Ultrasound in the Septic Patient,How to use ultrasound to guide management of patients with sepsis.,Michael Stone,7/29/2019,"Hi, I'm Dr. Sarnek Rivon. I'm a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist, intensivist, and point-of-care ultrasound specialist. One of the main reasons I use the butterfly IQ when I'm in the ICU is try to help understand why my patients are hemodynamically unstable. One of the common pathologies we see is septic shock, but septic shock has different stages. So I have to understand if my patients are in the under-resuscitated stage of septic shock. If they've been adequately resuscitated and now they're vasoplegic or if they have developed cardiomyopathy and that's why they're in septic shock. So I can use the butterfly IQ by going to the cardiac precept. It's like the preset button and we're gonna pick cardiac because this is a normal-sized gentleman. My go-to view really is the peristurnal short access view. So I'm gonna take the probe. I'm gonna place it in the third to fourth inner-costal space with the orientation marker pointed towards the patient's left shoulder and then I'm gonna slow scan down the chest until I get to the mid portions of the LV. And what I'm looking for here is to understand if the LV is thickening and approximating appropriately because if it is, and I know that this patient doesn't have cardiomyopathy as the reason for their shock. The other thing I'm looking to see is if this is hyperdynamic LV function and the LV is basically obliterating an endcystole because if it is, then I have to ask myself well is the patient under resuscitated or are they vasoplegic? The next view that I'll go to to kind of help differentiate that is the subcostal four chamber view where you're basically looking with the probe in the palm of your hand about two finger breasts below the xifoid and you're gonna take the orientation marker and put it to about 230. But you have to remember that this is going through the liver this view is and so you have to increase the depth and give yourself just a little bit more depth. And also because we're looking a little bit deeper sometimes you have to adjust the gain distally which we have the capability of doing with this device. So I'm gonna just increase the gain distally here just by sliding the spar over and as I do that you're gonna start to see the image a little bit more clearly distally. And from here you're looking at the RV to see does the RV look normal in size or does it look dilated? Does it look hypertrophy? Is there some sort of pathology there? Because if there is then you know you won't really be able to trust the IVC for your assessment of volume status. But if it looks good here and there's no bad tricuspid regurgitation you can just take your probe rotate it to the 12 o'clock position and when you do that you're basically gonna get the IVC interview here. And if the IVC looks small and collapsible with respiratory variations then you know your patient will likely respond to fluids. If the IVC is big and dilated greater than 2.2 centimeters and not really collapsing with respiratory variations then now you know you need to start vasopressors. So in just a few minutes you've figured out why your patient is hemodynamically unstable and able to direct your care. That's how I use the butterfly IQ when I'm in the ICU. [BLANK_AUDIO]"

So you have to be pretty quick in being able to assess whether your patient does have pericardial fluid surrounding the heart that's compressing the heart. When I start, I'm gonna basically go to the presets here and click on Cardiac. When I select Cardiac, it's gonna put me in the cardiac preset and I'll be able to take the probe, put it in the third to fourth intercostal space with the orientation marker pointed towards the patients right shoulder for the peristernal long access view. And I'm just gonna decrease the depth here just a little bit until I get to about 19 or 20 centimeters or so because what I wanna do is not only do I wanna see the peristernal long access view, which I'm seeing here, but I wanna be able to see the descending thoracic aorta, which is at the bottom of the screen, they are right underneath the heart. At the descending thoracic aorta helps you differentiate a pericardial effusion from a pleural effusion. So if the patient has a pericardial effusion, you'll see black coursing on top of the descending thoracic aorta. A pleural effusion would be below. So if I do see that, then I'm gonna zoom in just a little bit more so that I can actually take a look at the chambers of the heart because I wanna see what the RV is doing and what the left atrium are doing in particular. Do I see the right ventricle collapsing and early diastole or scalloping down? Is the left atrium collapsing and systole? And if I see those things that I'm probably gonna wanna verify in another view, oftentimes I'll go to the subcostal four chamber view and that's basically taking the pro, putting it in the palm of your hand. You're gonna go about two finger breaths below the zyphoid with the orientation marker pointed to about 230 or so. Now this is a deeper view. You're scanning through the liver. So you basically have to increase the depth until you get the whole heart into view. And also because it is deeper, oftentimes you need to use the TGC to just improve your gain distally. And when you do that, your image will get a little bit better. It'll come into view. And you're gonna look to see if you can find the right ventricle which is right below the liver on the screen. It's nice and elongated. But in a patient with tamponade, you would see black fluid surrounding the heart, separating the heart from the liver. And oftentimes you'll see the right ventricle scalloping down or collapsing and diastole. You may also see the right atrium doing the same insistally. From here you would rotate the probe towards the 12 o'clock position. So you could see the IVC and you have a beautiful view of the IVC here. And if patient with tamponade, you would see a plothoric dilated IVC that's not changing with respiratory variations. So you would have some concern if you had all of those findings in a patient that you had clinical suspicion that had tamponade that you needed to do something in order to relieve the pressure in the paracardial sac or space so that your patient was in a better spot. So that's how I use the butterfly IQ when I'm in the ICU or in the OR to evaluate for cardiac tamponade. (gentle music) [BLANK_AUDIO]"

Walk us through the classic femoral nerve block. So for the classic femoral nerve block, stay in the inguinal region. In your orientation marker is facing towards the lateral side here. You can find the femoral artery. The femoral nerve is lateral to the femoral artery. And one tip is to have a 90 degree orientation to the nerve. So try not to tilt in this direction. Stay at 90 degrees so that you can see the nerve just below the fascially aqua right next to the femoral artery. Inject below the nerve so that you know you're below the fascially aqua and you should have a successful femoral nerve block. Awesome. Thanks so much. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Tibial Nerve Block,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/HG6P62ZKQhybbAeexh1RJg,Nerve Blocks,Tibial Nerve Block,An introduction to the technique for performing an ultrasound-guided tibial nerve block,Michael Stone,7/29/2019,"So, Nadia, we were talking about tibial nerve blocks and I was saying I usually block the tibial nerve at the ankle for lacerations to the sole of the foot or foreign bodies or maybe a little bit higher for a calcaneal fracture but you'd mentioned that going up in the popliteal crease we'd get longer duration and I wanted to hear more about that maybe have you show me technique. Sure, so if you inject in the popliteal fossa here within the perinurium the duration of analgesia with just 10 mLs of local will be about 24 to 36 hours. So what you do is you start the popliteal fossa you identify the popliteal artery which you can see pulsating at the bottom of the screen here. The popliteal vein is superficial to that I'm going to relax so you can see it. I'm going to push back down and the hypercoextructure superficial to the vein is the tibial nerve. So this is where we would inject but we're going to confirm this is tibial nerve by scanning crannially and watching the common perinial nerve sort of join it to form the sciatic. So this is where we would do a classic popliteal sciatic block. So we're going to go back down on the leg we're going to follow the tibial nerve back to where it's right next to the vessels and this is where we would do a selective tibial nerve block. Now a couple of things that you want to make sure is that your common perinial nerve is not in the trajectory of your needle and you also want to make sure to inject on the top because the vein is beneath it. Okay so you're going superficial on the screen when you inject and you're coming lateral to medial. Yes. Okay and you said 10 mLs. 10 mLs if you do a little bit higher volume you may get spread to the common perinial and your patient will have foot drop and we'll be able to emulate. Okay so 10 mLs of local anesthetic two milligrams of dexamethasone lateral approach superficial to the tibial. Yes.

Quadratus Lumborum Block,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/tyLYLPzXQH6aNsULFlZuYA,Nerve Blocks,Quadratus Lumborum Block,An introduction to the technique for performing lateral and posterior quadratus lumborum plane blocks.,Michael Stone,7/29/2019,"Hey Nadia, I've been hearing a little bit about quadratus lumborum blocks and those are new for me. Can you show me when you'd use them and how you approach it? Sure, so the quadratus lumborum block is good for abdominal and pelvic pain. If you place the probe in a transverse position right over the rectus abdominis muscle, this is the image that you'll get right here. You can see the rectus abdominis muscle. Place it laterally and there's your linear semulonaris. As you keep going laterally, the three abdominal muscles come into view. You have the external oblique, the internal oblique and the transverse abdominis muscle. Now as you come on the trunk, you have to sort of rotate your probe so that these muscles stay in that same orientation. I'm going to increase the depth just a little bit. Now here you can see the end of the transverse abdominis muscle as it attaches to the quadratus lumborum. So the quadratus lumborum muscle is coming into view. This is the QL. If you inject lateral to the quadratus lumborum muscle, this is also known as a QL1 block. That's right at the end of the transverse abdominis. Right at the end of the transverse abdominis. If you inject posterior to the quadratus lumborum muscle, right in this fascia plane here, that's also known as a quadratus lumborum 2 block or a posterior QL. Now when you want to get into this fascia plane, it really does help to twist the needle a little bit with gentle pressure when you're there as opposed to just sort of going through and through into the muscle. The other thing that you want to be careful with is that the fascia plane that you're injected into here is that the racolumb or fascia, the vessels, run in that plane. So you do want to aspirate and inject every 5cc and maybe even putting a little color flow doppler on there to just make sure that you don't have any vessels is a good idea. And about how much volume are you using? 20ccs of dilute local anesthetic per side. So quarter percent bupivocaine, 0.2 percent rope-pivocaine will do the job. Fantastic. Thank you so much. Bye.

Para-Sternal Blocks,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/VerneMAVRqe9wVttaTYhqQ,Nerve Blocks,Para-Sternal Blocks,An introduction to the technique for performing para-sternal blocks for the relief of pain due to sternal fractures.,Michael Stone,7/29/2019,"So Nadia, we were talking earlier and I confessed that even though I treat patients with sternal fractures, I've never tried a block for a sternal fracture. So show me the way. How do we do this? So the sternum is innervated by the anterior cutaneous branch of the intercostal nerves. Now we saw earlier to block the lateral cutaneous branch we do a serratus plane block. For the anterior cutaneous branch, there are two different blocks you can do. If you place the ultrasound probe in a craniocato orientation just lateral to the sternum, this is the image that you'll get. You can see ribs, you can see the pec major over the ribs, the intercostal muscles connecting the ribs, and as you advance your probe immediately, this hypoacoke band between the pleura and the intercostal muscles is the transverse thoracic muscle. Now in that plane there is an internal mammary artery. So when you do inject in this plane, you have to make sure to aspirate and to use color doppler to identify this vessel. So the two blocks are the transverse thoracic muscle plane block, which is when you inject between the intercostal muscles and the transverse thoracic muscle. To do a safer version of this block, a more superficial version of this block, you would inject between the pec major and the intercostal muscles, and this block is called the pecto interfacial plane block. It's the same volume of local anesthetic 15cc per side, and the result is the same. They both block the anterior cutaneous branch of the intercostal nerves. Okay, so you need to hit both sides to get the sternum numb, and it's sort of like a serratus, right? You're basically just lifting the muscle off the ribs. Yes. Okay, thank you so much. You're welcome. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Serratus Plane Block,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/nwJZMUUCS3SSNSOuUGMQ6g,Nerve Blocks,Serratus Plane Block,An introduction to the technique for performing an ultrasound-guided serratus plane block.,Michael Stone,7/29/2019,"So Nadia, we were talking earlier and I know that the serratus plane block is your go-to block for control of pain due to rib fractures. Walk me through it. So for lateral rib fractures, we like to do the serratus plane block because it's nice and simple to do. If you place your probe in a cranial cotyl orientation in the mid-axillary line, give yourself about 3 to 4 centimeters of depth. The first thing you'll see is a rib. The rib is hypercoic with posterior acoustic shadowing. Just lateral to each side of the rib, you can see the pleura. Over the ribs is the serratus anterior muscle. Now to do this block, you can either inject above the muscle or below the muscle. I like to inject below the muscle because the rib is a very clear target. Also it's nice to aim at bone. That way you miss the pleura. Sort of a hard stop. Oh yes. And then let's say I was your assistant and I was holding the phone for you. Where would you insert the needle? So you can either come from a cranial cotyl or from a cotyl cranial direction. As long as you're in plane and you can see the needle the entire time, I would recommend either way. Okay. And then is this your go-to block for all rib fractures or are there cases where you'd use a different type of block? So this block anesthetizes the lateral branch. The lateral cutaneous branch of the intercostal nerves. So it only covers sort of lateral and anterior rib fractures. If they're very far posterior or very far anterior, you need different blocks for that. Okay. Thank you so much. Yeah. [BLANK_AUDIO]"

Okay So if you start with your femoral nerve in view and you scan straight lateral not towards the aces But just straight lateral you will run into a little bit more gel here You'll run into a sort of triangular muscle that is the sartorius muscle and cross-section We want to double check that that's the sartorius by tracing it to the anterior superior alex spine and watching its insertion If you want to you can block the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve here by injecting just medial to the anterior superior alex spine otherwise you can trace this a sartorius back down and then scan lateral until you see the tensor fascia lot of muscle pop up on screen the LcfN Lives right in between those two muscles at the top.

Transverse Suprainguinal Fascia Iliaca Block,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/sqSZmyw3SNmFu_NnUh-wtg,Nerve Blocks,Transverse Suprainguinal Fascia Iliaca Block,A transverse orientation may be helpful when performing suprainguinal fascia iliaca blocks in some patients.,Michael Stone,7/29/2019,"So Nadia, for the super inguinal fasciliacoblock, you've mentioned there are times where you'll turn the probe 90 degrees. What makes you do that and walk me through that? To do the super inguinal fasciliacoblock, you put your butterfly on the nerve setting and give yourself about three centimeters depth. The orientation marker is usually pointed cranial with the probe tilt-team towards the inside of the ileum. Now if there's a really big penis or the patient has a large body habitus, you sometimes can't tilt the way you want to to get the image. So in those cases all I do is I rotate my probe 90 degrees so that the orientation marker is pointing lateral and you can still see the same structures but in a different orientation. So you can see the hyper-cook line that is the ileum, you see the muscle covering the ileum which is the ileocous muscle and then you see the fascia playing covering the ileocous muscle which is the fascia ileocous. So it doesn't matter which way you're tilting here you can still see that fascia playing. Gotcha, thank you so much. [ Silence ]"

Okay, so the relevant anatomy is you feel for the anterior superior iliac spine. You put your ultrasound probe on the nerve setting and give yourself about three centimeters of depth. Hold the probe in a sagittal plane with the orientation marker pointing cranial and place it right over the anterior superior iliac spine. What you're going to see is a hypercoagline with posterior acoustic shadowing. That way you know you are on the bone. As you slide medially tilt toward the inside of the ilium so you can still see bone on your screen. You can find the iliacous muscle right over the ilium. If you slide crannially, you can see the internal oblique and if you slide coddly, you'll see the sartorius muscle. So those two muscles make the bowtie technique which is the same as the super-inguinal block. The injection point is right in between those two muscles at this level. So you can see the fascialyac a covering the iliacous muscle and injection will separate the muscle off that fascialy plane. And you can see the fascialyac.com."

The Common Bile Duct (CBD),https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/N-S9C2wmQUm7acyLcryJyQ,Gastrointestinal,The Common Bile Duct (CBD),An introduction to the basic technique for evaluating the common bile duct.,Michael Stone,7/29/2019,"To identify and measure the common bile duct, start with a transverse view of the gallbladder and slowly fan the IQ towards the patient's head until you visualize the portal vein running in longitudinal. Adding color flow will help identify the common bile duct as there should be no flow within the common bile duct. Once you've obtained a good image, freeze the screen, double tap to zoom, and use the caliper tool to measure from the inner edge of the common bile duct to the other inner edge. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
Measuring the Gallbladder Wall,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/XeK7756bQCWMkXhr9GH4QQ,Gastrointestinal,Measuring the Gallbladder Wall,"Measurements of the gallbladder wall should be performed on the anterior wall, and zoom may be of value to facilitate accurate caliper placement.",Michael Stone,7/29/2019,"To measure the gallbladder wall, get a transverse view of the gallbladder and freeze the screen. Double tap to zoom and use the caliper tool to measure the anterior gallbladder wall. [BLANK_AUDIO]"
TroubleshootingImaging from the Flank,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/kcOruaeyRoyCpity-b0Zqw,Aorta,TroubleshootingImaging from the Flank,"The aorta can also be visualized from the flank, especially in cases of difficult anterior imaging due to overlying bowel gas or abdominal tenderness.",Michael Stone,7/29/2019,"If abdominal pain or tenderness or overlying bowel gas prohibit you from getting a view of the abdominal aorta from the anterior approach, a transipatic approach from the right flank can allow you to visualize the aorta in a long axis. In this case we see the aorta deep to the inferior vena cava and we can freeze the screen, double tap to zoom, and use our calipers to obtain a measurement of the abdominal aorta from the right flank.

Longitudinal View,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/T0DV4LPfSFe8Fg-cq204Xg,Aorta,Longitudinal View,A longitudinal view of the abdominal aorta will facilitate accurate antero-posterior measurements of the supra-renal aorta.,Michael Stone,7/29/2019,"To obtain a long view of the abdominal aorta, start in the epigastrium and rotate the indicator towards the patient's head. To make sure you're looking at aorta, fan towards the patient's right and find the vena cava, and then fan back towards the patient's left and identify the abdominal aorta overlying the vertebral column. Once you've optimized your depth and your gain, freeze the screen and use your calipers to obtain a true perpendicular measurement of the proximal aorta, which can be challenging to do in a transverse plane.

Adjusting Depth During Exam,https://cloud.butterflynetwork.com/-/edu/0SGVEidgRkasn5xGlfOo_Q,Aorta,Adjusting Depth During Exam,"Decreasing the depth may be required as you carry the abdominal aorta evaluation caudally, due to the natural lordosis of the lumbar spine.",Michael Stone,7/29/2019,"A complete evaluation of the abdominal aorta requires following it from the diaphragm through to its bifurcation. As you're scanning the aorta and sliding distally, you'll notice that it moves superficially on the screen due to the lordosis of the lumbar spine. As a result, you'll want to decrease your depth as you scan distally following the abdominal aorta so that you can easily visualize it down through to its bifurcation into the iliac arteries. >> Okay."
